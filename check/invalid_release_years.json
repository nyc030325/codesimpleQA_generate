Unfortunately, there has never been a standard schema for the JUnit XML format. Common consumers of Clover XML log files interpret these files differently, which has led to frequent problems.\nTo address this, the JUnit team started the\nOpen Test Reporting project\n, creating and maintaining language-agnostic XML and HTML test reporting formats. Unlike JUnit XML, Open Test Reporting's XML formats are extensible.\nLogging in the Open Test Reporting XML format is controlled by the new\n--log-otr\nCLI option and the new\n<otr>\nXML configuration element.\nThis feature is experimental and the generated XML may change in order to enhance compliance with the Open Test Reporting project's XML schema definitions. The same applies to the XML schema definitions for information that is specific for PHP and PHPUnit. Please note that such changes may occur in bugfix or minor releases and could potentially break backwards compatibility.\nExperimental Support for OpenClover XML\nPHPUnit has supported reporting code coverage information in the Clover XML format for a long time. Unfortunately, there has never been a standard schema for the Clover XML format. Common consumers of Clover XML log files interpret these files differently, which leads to frequent problems.\nThe original commercial Clover project has been superseded by the Open Source OpenClover project, which provides an XML schema for its OpenClover XML format. Rather than modifying the existing Clover XML reporter to comply with the OpenClover XML schema, thereby breaking backward compatibility, a new OpenClover XML reporter has been introduced.\nThis new reporter is controlled by the new CLI option,\n--coverage-openclover\n, and the new XML configuration element,\n<openclover>\n. This code coverage reporter generates XML documents that validate against the OpenClover project's XML schema definition, with one exception: the\n<testproject>\nelement is not generated.\nThe existing Clover XML reporter, controlled by the\n--coverage-clover\nCLI option and the\n<clover>\nXML configuration element, remains unchanged.\nThis feature is experimental and the generated XML may change to enhance compliance with the OpenClover XML schema definition.

The changelog is relative to PHP-Parser 4.18.0.\nAdded\nAdded\nPhpVersion\nclass, which is accepted in a number of places (e.g. ParserFactory, Parser, Lexer, PrettyPrinter) and gives more precise control over the PHP version being targeted.\nAdded PHP 8 parser though it only differs from the PHP 7 parser in concatenation precedence.\nAdded\nParser::getTokens()\nmethod.\nAdded a\nModifiers\nclass, as a replacement for\nStmt\\Class_::MODIFIER_*\n.\nAdded support for returning an array or\nREMOVE_NODE\nfrom\nNodeVisitor::enterNode()\n.\nAdded many additional type annotations. PhpStan is now used.\nAdded a fuzzing target for PHP-Fuzzer, which was how a lot of pretty printer bugs were found.\nAdded\nisPromoted()\n,\nisPublic()\n,\nisProtected()\n,\nisPrivate()\nand\nisReadonly()\nmethods on\nParam\n.\nAdded support for class constants in trait builder.\nAdded\nPrettyPrinter\ninterface.\nAdded support for formatting preservation when toggling static modifiers.\nThe\nphp-parse\nbinary now accepts\n-\nas the file name, in which case it will read from stdin.\nAdded support for\nNodeVisitor::REPLACE_WITH_NULL\n.\nAdded support for CRLF newlines in the pretty printer, using the new\nnewline\noption.\nVisitors can now be passed directly to the\nNodeTraverser\nconstructor. A separate call to\naddVisitor()\nis no longer required.\nAdded support for printing additional attributes (like\nkind\n) in\nNodeDumper\n.\nAdded\nrawValue\nattribute to\nInterpolatedStringPart\nand heredoc/nowdoc\nString_\ns, which provides the original, unparsed value. It was previously only available for non-interpolated single/double quoted strings.\nAdded\nStmt\\Block\nto represent\n{}\ncode blocks. Previously, such code blocks were flattened into the parent statements array.\nStmt\\Block\nwill not be created for structures that are typically used with code blocks, for example\nif ($x) { $y; }\nwill be represented as previously, while\nif ($x) { { $x; } }\nwill have an extra\nStmt\\Block\nwrapper.\nChanged\nPHP 7.4 is now required to run PHP-Parser.\nProperty types have been added where possible.\nFormatting of the standard pretty printer has been adjusted to match PSR-12 more closely.\nThe internal token representation now uses a\nPhpParser\\Token\nclass, which is compatible with PHP 8 token representation (\nPhpToken\n).\nArray destructuring is now always represented using\nExpr\\List_\nnodes, even if it uses\n[]\nsyntax.\nRenamed a number of node classes, and moved things that were not real expressions/statements outside the\nExpr\n/\nStmt\nhierarchy. Compatibility shims for the old names have been retained.\nThe pretty printer no longer unconditionally wraps\nyield\nin parentheses, unless the target version is set to older than PHP 7.0.\nThe pretty printer now defaults to PHP 7.4 as the target version.\nPrint\nelse if { }\ninstead of\nelse { if { } }\n.\nThe\nleaveNode()\nmethod on visitors is now invoked in reverse order of\nenterNode()\n.\nMoved\nNodeTraverser::REMOVE_NODE\netc. to\nNodeVisitor::REMOVE_NODE\n. The old constants are still available for compatibility.\nThe\nName\nsubnode\nparts\nhas been replaced by\nname\n, which stores the name as a string rather than an array of parts separated by namespace separators. The\ngetParts()\nmethod returns the old representation.\nNo longer accept strings for types in Node constructors. Instead, either an\nIdentifier\n,\nName\nor\nComplexType\nmust be passed.\nComment::getReformattedText()\nnow normalizes CRLF newlines to LF newlines.\nThe\nLexer\nno longer accepts options.\nLexer\\Emulative\nonly accepts a\nPhpVersion\n. The\nstartLexing()\n,\ngetTokens()\nand\nhandleHaltCompiler()\nmethods have been removed. Instead, there is a single method\ntokenize()\nreturning the tokens.\nAttribute handling has been moved from the lexer to the parser, and is no longer configurable. The comments, startLine, endLine, startTokenPos, endTokenPos, startFilePos, and endFilePos attributes will always be added.\nThe pretty printer now indents heredoc/nowdoc strings if the target version is >= 7.3 (flexible heredoc/nowdoc).\nUse visitor to assign comments. This fixes the long-standing issue where comments were assigned to all nodes sharing a starting position. Now only the outer-most node will hold the comments.\nImprove NodeDumper performance for large dumps.\nRemoved\nThe PHP 5 parser has been removed. The PHP 7 parser has been adjusted to deal with PHP 5 code more gracefully.\nRemoved deprecated\nError\nconstructor taking a line number instead of an attributes array.\nThe deprecated\nComment::getLine()\n,\nComment::getTokenPos()\nand\nComment::getFilePos()\nmethods have been removed. Use\nComment::getStartLine()\n,\nComment::getStartTokenPos()\nand\nComment::getStartFilePos()\ninstead.\nRemoved\nStmt\\Throw_\nnode, use\nExpr\\Throw_\ninside\nStmt\\Expression\ninstead.\nRemoved\nParserFactory::create()\n.\nFixed\nThe pretty printer now uses a more accurate treatment of unary operator precedence, and will only wrap them in parentheses if required. This allowed fixing a number of other precedence related bugs.\nThe pretty printer now respects the precedence of\nclone\n,\nthrow\nand arrow functions.\nFixed formatting preservation for alternative elseif/else syntax.\nFixed checks for when it is safe to print strings as heredoc/nowdoc to accommodate flexible doc string semantics.\nFixed various cases where\n\\r\nat the end of a doc string could be incorrectly merged into a CRLF sequence with a following\n\\n\n.\n__halt_compiler\nis no longer recognized as a semi-reserved keyword, in line with PHP behavior.\n<?=\nis no longer recognized as a semi-reserved keyword.\nFix handling of very large overflowing\n\\u\nescape sequences.\nDon't trim leading whitespace in formatting preserving printer.\nTreat DEL as a label character in the formatting preserving printer depending on the targeted PHP version.\nFix error reporting in emulative lexer without explicitly specified error handler.\nGracefully handle non-contiguous array indices in the\nDiffer\n.\nDeprecated\nThe\nNode::getLine()\nmethod has been deprecated.
