        "content": "Linux 6.9\nwas released\non Sunday, 12 of May 2024\n1. Prominent features\n1.1. pidfd: pidfds for threads and pidfs\npifds (PID fd, a file descriptor that represents a process) is a concept that was added first in\nLinux 5.3\nto deal with the problems of traditional PIDs, and it has been gaining support in several APIs since then. In this release, pidfds add a few features:\nCreate pidfds for threads. Until now pidfds could only be created for thread-group leaders\nclone()\nand\nclone3()\ncan now be called with\nCLONE_PIDFD | CLONE_THREAD\nMoving pidfds to a tiny pseudo filesystem that allows several improvements\nRecommended LWN article:\nA new filesystem for pidfds\n1.2. x86 FRED support\nFRED (Fast Return and Event Delivery) is a new architecture on Intel processors that defines simple new transitions that change privilege level (ring transitions). It is a replacement for IDT event delivery on x86 and addresses most of the technical nightmares which IDT exposes.\nDocumentation\n1.3. BPF improvements: arenas and tokens\nThis new release incorporates, as usual, new BPF features. A couple of features stand out from the rest:\nBPF arenas: a sparse shared memory region between the BPF program and user space\nBPF tokens: provides the ability to delegate a subset of BPF subsystem functionality from privileged system-wide daemon (e.g., systemd or any other container manager) through special mount options for userns-bound BPF FS to a trusted unprivileged application. The main motivation is to enable containerized BPF applications to be used together with user namespaces. This is currently impossible, as CAP_BPF, required for BPF subsystem usage, cannot be namespaced or sandboxed, as a general rule.\nRecommended LWN articles:\nA proposal for shared memory in BPF programs\nFiner-grained BPF tokens\n1.4. Host support for AMD Secure Nested Paging\nAMD EPYC systems utilizing Zen 3 and newer microarchitectures add support for a new feature called SEV-SNP, which adds Secure Nested Paging support on top of the SEV/SEV-ES support already present on existing EPYC systems. This release adds support for acting as a KVM host capable of running SNP guests. One of the main features of SNP is the addition of an RMP (Reverse Map) table to enforce additional security protections for private guest memory.\n1.5. Weighted interleaving memory policies\nWhen trying to allocate memory, the kernel has to decide from which node NUMA node it should allocate that memory. The existing memory interleave mechanism does an even round-robin distribution of memory across all nodes. This release provides a weighted interleave mechanism that distributes memory across nodes according to a provided weight, which helps to provide greater use of the total available memory bandwidth.\nRecommended LWN article:\nWeighted interleaving for memory tiering\n1.6. Faster FUSE I/O\nThis release adds a passthrough mode for regular file I/O. This allows performing read and write (also via memory maps) on a backing file without incurring the overhead of roundtrips to userspace. For now this is only allowed to privileged servers, but this limitation will go away in the future.\nRecommended LWN article:\nFUSE passthrough for file I/O\n1.7. Slightly faster timer setup\nKernel code uses a lot of timers which are canceled or rearmed before they expire. However, when timers are enqueued a target CPU is choosen, which is wasted time if these timers are not going to be used. In this release, the CPU selection is avoided whenever possible, which makes some hot code paths in the kernel a bit faster in optional cases.\nRecommended LWN article:\nBetter CPU selection for timer expiration\n1.8. Device mapper VDO deduplication target\nThis release adds a new device mapper VDO (virtual data optimizer) target which provides block-level deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning. As a device mapper target, it can add these features to the storage stack, compatible with any file system. The vdo target does not protect against data corruption, relying instead on integrity protection of the storage below it.\nDocumentation:\ndm-vdo\nDocumentation:\nDesign of dm-vdo\n2.

This is similar to ARM's Top Byte Ignore and allows userspace to use some bits of pointers without masking it out before use, allowing sofware to use these untranslated address bits for metadata. The capability can be used for efficient address sanitizers (ASAN) implementation and for optimizations in JITs and virtual machines\nRecommended LWN article:\nSupport for Intel's Linear Address Masking\n1.2. Unprivileged Pressure Stall Information\nThis release allows for unprivileged\nPSI\npolling, which allow unprivileged tools to provide this information to users.\n1.3. New API for User-space trace events\nA new API has been added for user-space trace events. In this new model during the event registration from user programs 3 new values are specified. The first is the address to update when the event is either enabled or disabled. The second is the bit to set/clear to reflect the event being enabled. The third is the size of the value at the specified address\nRecommended LWN article:\nUser trace events, one year later\n.\n1.4. Safer Kernel Samepage Merging with a new process/cgroup API\nSo far KSM can only be enabled by calling\nmadvise()\nfor memory regions, but this API is too insecure. To be able to use KSM for more workloads, KSM needs to have the ability to be enabled and disabled at the process / cgroup level. This release adds two new options to the prctl system call. The first one allows to enable KSM at the process level and the second one to query the setting\nRecommended LWN article:\nProcess-level kernel samepage merging control\n1.5. More scalable memory management with per-VMA locks\nThe memory management subsystem has added a new kind of locks in each VMA (Virtual Memory Area, a data structure that representes virtual memory) which means that some operations will no longer use the\nmmap_lock\n. This improves scalability in a number of scenarios. For example, startup of Android apps with a large number of threads.\nRecommended LWN article:\nConcurrent page-fault handling with per-VMA locks\n1.6. More scalable context switching between user and kernel threads\nThis release improves scalability of context switching between user and kernel threads on large systems with a threaded process spread across a lot of CPUs\nThis takes lazy tlb mm shootdown IPI interrupts from 314 to 3 on a 144 POWERPC CPU system doing a kernel compile.\n1.7. New BPF features\nAs usual, this release brings new\nBPF open-coded iterators, support for kptrs in more BPF maps, kptr RCU, shared ownership for local kptrs, support 64-bit pointers to kfuncs, or first class support for attaching uprobes to functions inside ELF objects containers in Android APKs.\nRecommended LWN article:\nGeneric iterators for BPF\n1.8. Removal of the SELinux runtime disable capability\nFor security reasons, the ability to diable SELinux at runtime has been removed.\nRecommended LWN article:\nDisabling SELinux's runtime disable\n2.

Some applications use timeouts to wake someone waiting on completion entries, and this makes it a bit easier to just have a recurring timer rather than needing to rearm it every time\ncommit\nTake advantage of completion batching for uring commands\ncommit\ntask scheduler\nInterleave cfs bandwidth timers for improved single thread performance at low utilization\ncommit\nReduce cost of sched_move_task when config autogroup\ncommit\nFix performance regression introduced by mm_cid\ncommit\nprctl: Add PR_GET_AUXV to copy auxv to userspace\ncommit\nAdd Kthread flag to /proc/$pid/status\ncommit\npipes: support\nFMODE_NOWAIT\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nlocking\nlocking: Introduce local{,64}_try_cmpxchg\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nRemove diagnostics and adjust config for CSD lock diagnostics\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nrwbase: Mitigate indefinite writer starvation\ncommit\nRust\nAdd uapi crate\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: introduce\nLock\nand\nGuard\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nRust pin-init API for pinned initialization of structs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nalloc: vec: Add some missing fallible try_* methods\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: Arc: Any downcasting and assume_init()\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: Arc: Implement Debug and Display\ncommit\nerror: Add missing wrappers to convert to/from kernel error codes\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\ntools/nolibc\nAdding stdint.h, more integer types and tests\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nAdd support for stack protector\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nSupport vprintf() so we can use kselftest.h with nolibc\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsplice: report related fsnotify events\ncommit\nswiotlb: Track and report io_tlb_used high water marks in debugfs\ncommit\nobjtool: Add stackleak instrumentation to uaccess safe list\ncommit\nAdd CONFIG_FW_DEVLINK_SYNC_STATE_TIMEOUT so that board specific kernels could enable it and not have to deal with setting or cluttering the kernel commandline\ncommit\nrtla/timerlat: Add auto-analysis only option\ncommit\nAdd vendor agnostic mechanism to report hardware sleep. A new file in suspend_stats is added where drivers can report into during their resume routine\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nGive more control of sync_state() in the form of a kernel commandline for a global timeout or a per device sysfs control to trigger sync_state()\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nptrace: Provide set/get interface for syscall user dispatch\ncommit\n3. File systems\n3.1. BTRFS\nImprove logging changes in a directory during one transaction, avoid iterating over items and reduce lock contention (fsync time 4x lower)\ncommit\nWhen logging directory entries during one transaction, reduce locking of subvolume trees by checking tree-log instead (improvement in throughput and latency for concurrent access to a subvolume)\ncommit\nscrub: rewrite scrub code flow, restructure how the stripes are enumerated and verified in a more unified way\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n3.2.

F2FS\nSupport iopoll method\ncommit\n3.6. NFS\nNFSD support for RPC-with-TLS (\nRFC 9289\n). The goal is to provide a simple-to-deploy, low-overhead in-transit confidentiality and peer authentication mechanism. It can supplement NFS Kerberos and it can protect the use of legacy non-cryptographic user authentication flavors such as AUTH_SYS. The TLS Record protocol is handled entirely by kTLS, meaning it can use either software encryption or offload encryption to smart NICs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nNFSv3: handle out-of-order write replies\ncommit\nConvert readdir to use folios\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nConvert the NFS fscache code to use netfs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n3.7. 9P\nRemove writeback fid and fix per-file modes\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nAllow disable of xattr support on mount\ncommit\n4.

Mount notifications\nThis release includes an API to listen for mount topology changes without requiring looking at\n/proc/<pid>/mountinfo\n. A mount namespace file descriptor can be supplied and registered with\nfanotify()\nto listen for mount topology changes.\nCurrently notifications for mount, umount and moving mounts are generated. The generated notification record contains the unique mount id of the mount, which can then be used with\nlistmount()\nand\nstatmount()\n.\n1.2. Allow creating idmapped mounts from idmapped mounts\nIn previous releases it wasn't possible to allow the creation of idmapped mounts from already idmapped mounts. This release adds a new system call,\nopen_tree_attr()\nwhich works just like open_tree() but takes an optional struct mount_attr parameter.\n1.3. Support creating detached mounts from a detached mount\nCurrently, detached mounts can only be created from attached mounts. This limitaton prevents various use-cases. For example, the ability to mount a subdirectory without ever having to make the whole filesystem visible first. This release removes this limitation.\n1.4. Allow mount detached mounts on detached mounts\nCurrently, detached mounts can only be mounted onto attached mounts. This limitation makes it impossible to assemble a new private rootfs and move it into place. Instead, a detached tree must be created, attached, then mounted open and then either moved or detached again. This release lifts this restriction.\n1.5. Support detached mounts in overlayfs\nSince last cycle, overlayfs supports specifying layers via file descriptors. However, it does not allow detached mounts which means userspace cannot user file descriptors received via\nopen_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE)\nand\nfsmount()\ndirectly, they have to do dirty tricks. This release allows to directly use detached mounts.\n1.6. Support for broadcast TLB invalidation using AMD's INVLPGB instruction\nThis release adds support for the INVLPGB instruction on AMD systems that support it (Zen 3 and later). It allows the kernel to invalidate TLB entries on remote CPUs without needing to send IPIs, without having to wait for remote CPUs to handle those interrupts, and with less interruption to what was running on those CPUs. If you didn't understand any of these words, it means\nbetter overall performance\n.\n1.7. Support for latency profiling in perf\nThis release introduces latency profiling using scheduler information. The latency profiling is to show impacts on wall-time rather than cpu-time. By tracking context switches, it can weight samples and find which part of the code contributed more to the execution latency.\nAn example (after pasing\n--latency\nto perf record):\n$ perf report -s comm\n...\n#\n# Overhead   Latency  Command\n# ........  ........  ...............\n#\n78.97%    48.66%  cc1\n6.54%    25.68%  python3\n4.21%     0.39%  shellcheck\n3.28%    13.70%  ld\n[...]\nYou can see latency of cc1 is around 50% and python3 and ld contribute a lot more than their overhead.\n1.8. io_uring networking support for zero-copy receive\nThis release adds support for zero-copy receive with io_uring, enabling fast bulk receive of data directly into application memory, rather than needing to copy the data out of kernel memory. While this version only supports host memory as that was the initial target, other memory types are planned in the future as well.\nThis release also adds support for reading epoll events via io_uring. While this may seem counter-intuitive (and/or productive), the reasoning here is that quite a few existing epoll event loops can easily do a partial conversion to a completion based model, but are still stuck with one (or few) event types that remain readiness based.\n1.9. New fwctl subsystem to standarize firmware management\nfwctl is a new subsystem intended to bring some common rules and order to the growing pattern of exposing a secure FW interface directly to userspace. Unlike existing places like RDMA/DRM/VFIO/uacce that are exposing a device for datapath operations fwctl is focused on debugging, configuration and provisioning of the device.\nDocumentation:\nfwctl subsystem\n1.10. bcachefs improvements\nThis release adds some important features to the bcachefs filesystem, like scrubbing and support for blocksize greater than page size, and casefolding support.

Release 3.46.0 On 2024-05-23\nEnhance PRAGMA optimize in multiple ways, to make it\n     simpler to use:\n     \n PRAGMA optimize automatically implements a temporary\n          analysis limit to prevent excess runtime\n          on large databases.\n      Added the new 0x10000 bitmask option to check for updates on all tables.\n      Automatically re-analyze tables that do not have sqlite_stat1 entries.\n     \n Enhancements to the date and time functions:\n     \n The strftime() SQL function now supports %G, %g, %U, and %V.\n      New modifiers 'ceiling' and 'floor' control the algorithm used to\n          resolve ambiguous dates when shifting a date by an integer number\n          of months and/or years.\n      The 'utc' and 'localtime' modifiers are now no-ops if SQLite knows\n          that the time is already in UTC or in the localtime, respectively.\n     \n Add support for underscore (\"_\") characters between digits in\n     numeric literals.\n Add the json_pretty() SQL function.\n Query planner improvements:\n     \n The \"VALUES-as-coroutine\" optimization enables INSERT statements with \n          thousands of rows in the VALUES clause to parse and run in about half\n          the time and using about half as much memory.\n      Allow the use of an index for queries like \"SELECT count(DISTINCT col) FROM ...\",\n          even if the index records are not smaller than the table records.\n      Improved recognition of cases where the value of an SQL function is\n          constant because all its arguments are constant.\n      Enhance the WHERE-clause push-down optimization so that it is able to\n          push down WHERE clause terms containing uncorrelated subqueries.\n     \n Allocate additional memory from the heap for the SQL parser stack if\n     that stack overflows, rather than reporting a \"parser stack overflow\" error.\n JSON changes:\n     \n Allow ASCII control characters within JSON5 string literals.\n      Fix the -> and ->> operators so that when the right-hand side operand is a string\n          that looks like an integer it is still treated as a string, because that is what\n          PostgreSQL does.\n     \n Allow large hexadecimal literals to be used as the DEFAULT value to a table column.\nHashes:\nSQLITE_SOURCE_ID: 2024-05-23 13:25:27

For information about new features in major release 17, see Section E.8.\nE.3.1. Migration to Version 17.5 #\nA dump/restore is not required for those running 17.X.\nHowever, if you have any self-referential foreign key constraints on partitioned tables, it may be necessary to recreate those constraints to ensure that they are being enforced correctly. See the second changelog entry below.\nAlso, if you have any BRIN bloom indexes, it may be advisable to reindex them after updating. See the third changelog entry below.\nAlso, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 17.1, see Section E.7.\nE.3.2. Changes #\nAvoid one-byte buffer overread when examining invalidly-encoded strings that are claimed to be in GB18030 encoding (Noah Misch, Andres Freund) § §\nWhile unlikely, a SIGSEGV crash could occur if an incomplete multibyte character appeared at the end of memory. This was possible both in the server and in libpq-using applications.

This was possible both in the server and in libpq-using applications. (CVE-2025-4207)\nHandle self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables correctly (Álvaro Herrera) §\nCreating or attaching partitions failed to make the required catalog entries for a foreign-key constraint, if the table referenced by the constraint was the same partitioned table. This resulted in failure to enforce the constraint fully.\nTo fix this, you should drop and recreate any self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables, if partitions have been created or attached since the constraint was created. Bear in mind that violating rows might already be present, in which case recreating the constraint will fail, and you'll need to fix up those rows before trying again.\nHandle self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables correctly (Álvaro Herrera) §\nCreating or attaching partitions failed to make the required catalog entries for a foreign-key constraint, if the table referenced by the constraint was the same partitioned table.

It's substantially more likely to be hit in v17 because parallel index builds now use the code.\nAvoid data loss when merging compressed BRIN summaries in brin_bloom_union() (Tomas Vondra) §\nbrin_bloom_union()\nThe code failed to account for decompression results not being identical to the input objects, which would result in failure to add some of the data to the merged summary, leading to missed rows in index searches.\nThis mistake was present back to v14 where BRIN bloom indexes were introduced, but this code path was only rarely reached then.

But this is problematic if the aggregate inputs include expressions that could fail (for example, a division where some of the input divisors could be zero) and there is a FILTER clause that's meant to prevent such failures. Pre-sorting would push the expression evaluations to before the FILTER test, allowing the failures to happen anyway. Avoid this by not pre-sorting if there's a FILTER and the input expressions are anything more complex than a simple Var or Const.\nAvoid premature evaluation of the arguments of an aggregate function that has both FILTER and ORDER BY (or DISTINCT) options (David Rowley) §\nFILTER\nORDER BY\nDISTINCT\nIf there is ORDER BY or DISTINCT, we consider pre-sorting the aggregate input values rather than doing the sort within the Agg plan node.

For information about new features in major release 16, see Section E.12.\nE.9.1. Migration to Version 16.3 #\nA dump/restore is not required for those running 16.X.\nHowever, a security vulnerability was found in the system views pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs, potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they shouldn't. If this is of concern in your installation, follow the steps in the first changelog entry below to rectify it.\npg_stats_ext\npg_stats_ext_exprs\nAlso, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 16.2, see Section E.10.\nE.9.2. Changes #\nRestrict visibility of pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs entries to the table owner (Nathan Bossart) §\nThese views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve columns the accessing user does not have permission to read. View columns such as most_common_vals might expose security-relevant data. The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated table.\nThe PostgreSQL Project thanks Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem.

        "content": "It's been\n7 months\nsince latest raylib release. As usual,\nmany parts of the library have been reviewed and improved\nalong those months. Many issues have been closed, staying under 10 open issues at the moment of this writting and also many PRs from contributors have been received, reviewed and merged into raylib library. Some new functions have been added and some others have been removed to improve library coherence and avoid moving too high level, giving the users the tools to implement advance functionality themselfs over raylib. Again, this is a big release with a considerable amount of changes and improvements. Here it is a small summary highlighting this new\nrayib 4.5\n.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+100\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1340\n!)\n+350\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+6350\n!)\n+25\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n516\n!)\n+40\nfunctions REVIEWED/REDESIGNED\n+40\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n405\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 4.5\n:\nNEW\nImproved ANGLE support on Desktop platforms\n: Support for OpenGL ES 2.0 on Desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) has been reviewed by\n@wtnbgo\nGitHub user. Now raylib can be compiled on desktop for OpenGL ES 2.0 and linked against\nANGLE\n. This\nsmall\naddition open the door to building raylib for all\nANGLE supported backends: Direct3D 11, Vulkan and Metal\n. Please note that this new feature is still experimental and requires further testing!\nNEW\nCamera module\n: A brand new implementation from scratch for\nrcamera\nmodule, contributed by\n@Crydsch\nGitHub user!\nNew camera system is simpler, more flexible, more granular and more extendable\n. Specific camera math transformations (movement/rotation) have been moved to individual functions, exposing them to users if required. Global state has been removed from the module and standalone usage has been greatly improved; now\nrcamera.h\nsingle-file header-only library can be used externally, independently of raylib. A new\nUpdateCameraPro()\nfunction has been added to address input-dependency of\nUpdateCamera()\n, now advance users have\nfull control over camera inputs and movement/rotation speeds\n!\nNEW\nSupport for M3D models and M3D/GLTF animations\n: 3d models animations support has been a limited aspect of raylib for long time, some versions ago IQM animations were supported but raylib 4.5 also adds support for the brand new\nM3D file format\n, including animations and the long expected support for\nGLTF animations\n! The new M3D file format is\nsimple, portable, feature complete, extensible and open source\n. It also provides a complete set of tools to export/visualize M3D models from/to Blender! Now raylib supports up to\n3 model file-formats with animations\n:\nIQM\n,\nGLTF\nand\nM3D\n.\nNEW\nSupport QOA audio format (import/export)\n: Just a couple of months ago the new\nQOA file format\nwas published, a very simple, portable and open source quite-ok-audio file format. raylib already supports it, added to\nraudio\nmodule and including audio loading from file, loading from memory, streaming from file, streaming from memory and\nexporting to QOA\naudio format.\nBecause simplicity really matters to raylib!\nNEW\nModule for compressed textures loading\n:\nrl_gputex\n, a portable single-file header-only small library to load compressed texture file-formats (DDS, PKM, KTX, PVR, ASTC). Provided functionality is not new to raylib but it was part of the raylib\nrtextures\nmodule, now it has been moved into a separate self-contained library,\nimproving portability\n. Note that this module is only intended to\nload compressed data from files, ready to be uploaded to GPU\n, no compression/decompression functionality is provided. This change is a first step towards a better modularization of raylib library.\nReviewed\nrlgl\nmodule for automatic limits checking\n: Again,\nrlgl\nhas been reviewed to simplify usage. Now users do not need to worry about reaching the internal render-batch limits when they send their triangles to draw 2d/3d,\nrlgl\nmanages it automatically! This change allows a\ngreat simplification for other modules\nlike\nrshapes\n,\nrtextures\nand\nrmodels\nthat do not need to worry about bufffer overflows and can just define as many vertex as desired!\nReviewed\nrshapes\nmodule to minimize the rlgl dependency\n: Now\nrshapes\n2d shapes drawing functions\nonly depend on 6 low-level functions\n:\nrlBegin()\n,\nrlEnd()\n,\nrlVertex3f()\n,\nrlTexCoord2f()\n,\nrlNormal3f()\n,\nrlSetTexture()\n. With only those pseudo-OpenGl 1.1 minimal functionality, everything can be drawn! This improvement converts\nrshapes\nmodule in a\nself-contained, portable shapes-drawing library that can be used independently of raylib\n, as far as entry points for those 6 functions are provided by the user. It even allows to be used for software rendering, with the proper backend!\nAdded data structures validation functions\n: Multiple functions have been added by\n@RobLoach\nGitHub user to ease the validation of raylib data structures:\nIsImageReady()\n,\nIsTextureReady()\n,\nIsSoundReady()\n... Now users have a simple mechanism to\nmake sure data has been correctly loaded\n, instead of checking internal structure values by themselfs.\nAs usual, those are only some highlights but there is much more! New image generators, new color transformation functionality, improved blending support for color/alpha, etc... Make sure to check raylib\nCHANGELOG\nfor a detailed list of changes! Please, note that all breaking changes have been flagged with a\nWARNING\nin the CHANGELOG, specially useful for binding creators!\nraylib keeps improving one more version\nwith a special focus on maintainability and sustainability. Always working towards making the library more\nsimple and easy-to-use\n.\nLet's keep\nenjoying games/tools/graphics programming!\n:)\nNew Contributors\n@trumoose\nmade their first contribution in\n#2640\n@daipom\nmade their first contribution in\n#2643\n@disketteman made their first contribution in\n#2682\n@acejacek\nmade their first contribution in\n#2685\n@skylar779\nmade their first contribution in\n#2687\n@murilluhenrique\nmade their first contribution in\n#2696\n@AQuantumPotato\nmade their first contribution in\n#2701\n@deniska\nmade their first contribution in\n#2702\n@bXi\nmade their first contribution in\n#2719\n@realtradam\nmade their first contribution in\n#2737\n@pure01fx\nmade their first contribution in\n#2741\n@JupiterRider\nmade their first contribution in\n#2745\n@SzieberthAdam\nmade their first contribution in\n#2746\n@hatkidchan\nmade their first contribution in\n#2750\n@Anut-py\nmade their first contribution in\n#2753\n@Its-Kenta\nmade their first contribution in\n#2757\n@IanBand made their first contribution in\n#2761\n@InKryption\nmade their first contribution in\n#2763\n@IsaacTCB\nmade their first contribution in\n#2783\n@RomanAkberov made their first contribution in\n#2786\n@RGDTAB\nmade their first contribution in\n#2787\n@SpexGuy\nmade their first contribution in\n#2793\n@shelvick\nmade their first contribution in\n#2796\n@Pere001\nmade their first contribution in\n#2800\n@jtainer\nmade their first contribution in\n#2797\n@lxmcf\nmade their first contribution in\n#2804\n@simendsjo\nmade their first contribution in\n#2826\n@AlxHnr\nmade their first contribution in\n#2829\n@turborium\nmade their first contribution in\n#2838\n@Wytekol\nmade their first contribution in\n#2846\n@BugraAlptekinSari made their first contribution in\n#2836\n@charles-l\nmade their first contribution in\n#2844\n@wtnbgo\nmade their first contribution in\n#2840\n@ImazighenGhost\nmade their first contribution in\n#2857\n@masoudd\nmade their first contribution in\n#2870\n@KOLANICH\nmade their first contribution in\n#2877\n@PencilAmazing\nmade their first contribution in\n#2882\n@the-argus\nmade their first contribution in\n#2905\n@haved\nmade their first contribution in\n#2909\n@star-tek-mb\nmade their first contribution in\n#2910\n@stickm4n\nmade their first contribution in\n#2914\n@fubark\nmade their first contribution in\n#2939\n@Skaytacium\nmade their first contribution in\n#2951\n@ashn-dot-dev\nmade their first contribution in\n#2958\n@Brian-ED\nmade their first contribution in\n#2962\nFull Changelog\n:\n4.2.0...4.5.0",

        "content": "It's been\n7 months\nsince latest raylib release and\n10 years\nsince raylib 1.0 was officially released... what an adventure! In the last 10 years raylib has improved a lot, new functions have been added, many new features and improvements implemented, up to\n500 contributors\nhave helped to shape the library as it is today.\nraylib 5.0\nis the final result of all this incredible amount of work and dedication. Here it is the summary with the key features and additions of this NEW major version of raylib.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+200\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1540\n!)\n+550\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+6950\n!)\n+35\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n552\n!)\n+60\nfunctions REVIEWED/REDESIGNED\n+80\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n+500\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 5.0\n:\nrcore\nmodule platform-split\n: Probably the biggest raylib redesign in the last 10 years. raylib started as a library targeting 3 desktop platforms:\nWindows\n,\nLinux\nand\nmacOS\n(thanks to\nGLFW\nunderlying library) but with the years support for several new platforms has been added (\nAndroid\n,\nWeb\n,\nRapsberry Pi\n,\nRPI native\n...); lot of the platform code was shared so the logic was all together on\nrcore.c\nmodule, separated by compilation flags. This approach was very handy but also made it very difficult to support new platforms and specially painful for contributors not familiar with the module, navigating +8000 lines of code in a single file. A big redesign was really needed but the amount of work required was humungus and quite scary for a solo-developer like me, moreover considering that everything was working and the chances to break things were really high. Fortunately, some contributors were ready for the task (@ubkp,\n@michaelfiber\n,\n@Bigfoot71\n) and thanks to their initiative and super-hard work, the\nrcore\nplatform split\nhas been possible! This new raylib architecture greatly improves the platforms maintenance but also greatly simplifies the addition of new platforms. A\nplatforms/rcore_template.c\nfile is provided with the required structure and functions to be filled for the addition of new platforms, actually it has been simplified to mostly filling some pre-defined functions:\nInitPlatform()\n,\nClosePlatform\n,\nPollInputEvents\n... Undoubtely,\nthis redesign opens the doors to a new era for raylib\n, letting the users to plug new platforms as desired.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: SDL\n: Thanks to the new\nrcore\nplatform-split, the addition of new platforms/backends to raylib has been greatly simplified. As a proof of concept,\nSDL2\nplatform backend has been added to raylib as an aternative for\nGLFW\nlibrary for desktop builds:\nplatforms/rcore_desktop_sdl\n. Lot of work has been put to provide exactly the same features as the other platforms and carefully test the new implementation. Now\nSDL2\nfans can use this new backend, just providing the required include libraries on compilation and linkage (not included in raylib, like\nGLFW\n).\nSDL\nbackend support also\neases the process of supporting a wider range of platforms\nthat already support\nSDL\n.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: Nintendo Switch (closed source)\n: The addition of the\nSDL\nbackend was quite a challenge but to really verify the robustness and ease of the new platform plugin system, adding support for a console was a more demanding adventure. Surprisingly, only two days of work were required to add support for\nNintendo Switch\nto raylib! Implementation result showed an outstanding level of simplicity, with a\nself-contained module\n(\nrcore_swith.cpp\n) supporting graphics and inputs. Unfortunately this module can not be open-sourced due to licensing restrictions.\nNEW\nSplines drawing and evaluation API\n: A complete set of functions has been added to\ndraw\nand\nevaluate\ndifferent types of splines:\nLinear\n,\nBasis\n,\nCatmull-Rom\n,\nQuadratic Bezier\nand\nCubic Bezier\n. Splines are extremely useful for game development (describe paths, control NPC movement...) but they can also be very useful on tools development (node-conections, elements-movement, 3d modelling, animations...). This was the missing feature on the raylib\nrshapes\nmodule to make it complete! Note that\nrshapes\nmodule can also be used independently of raylib just providing the\nonly 6 functions required for vertex definition and drawing\n.\nNEW\nPseudo-random numbers generator: rprand\n: After several years of users asking for this missing piece, a brand new pseudo-random generator module has been added to raylib.\nrprand\nimplements the\nXoshiro128**\nalgorithm combined with\nSplitMix64\n, specially suited for\nfast software pseudo-random numbers generation\n. The module also implies some useful functions to generate non-repetitive random numbers sequences, functionality exposed by raylib. usage of this module can be controlled by a compilation flag, in case the default libc\nrand()\nfunction was preferred.\nNEW\nAutomation Events System API\n: This new system was first added in\nraylib 4.0\nas an experimental feature but it was a bit clumsy and there was no API exposed to users. For the new\nraylib 5.0\nthe system has been redesigned and\nproper API\nadded for the users. With this new events automation system, users can\nrecord input events for later replay\n, very useful feature for testing automation, tutorials generation, assisted game playing, in-game cinematics, speedruns saving or even AI assited game playing!\nNEW\nraygui 4.0\n: The\nofficial raylib immediate-mode gui library\ndesigned for tools development has been updated to a new version, aligned with raylib 5.0. This new version is a complete redesign of raygui to unify all controls structure and usage, now all controls have the same function signature!.\nraygui\nhas been battle-tested with the development of +12 published tools in the last few years. The tools can be seen and used for free in the\nraylib technologies tools page\n. Worth mentioning that several of those\ntools have been open sourced\nfor anyone to use, compile, contribute or learn how the code works.\nNEW\nraylib web examples functionality\n: Beside the addition of several new examples, the web examples functionality has been improved. Examples have been organized by\ncomplexity level\n, marked with one star for simple examples and up to 4 stars for more complex ones. A new option has been added to web to allow to\nfilter examples by function-name\nusage, to ease the learning process when looking for an usage example of some function. Finally,\nopen-graph metadata\ninformation has been added to all examples individual webpages, improving a the visuals and information when sharing those webpages on social networks, sharing the example screenshot and details.\nAs always, those are only some highlights of the new\nraylib 5.0\nbut there is many more improvements! Support for 16-bit HDR images/textures, SVG loading and scaling support, new OpenGL ES 3.0 graphic backend, new image gradient generators, sound alias loading, improved 3d models loading, multiple optimizations, new bindings, CodeQL integration and much more!\nMake sure to check raylib CHANGELOG for a detailed list of changes!\nUndoubtely, this is the\nbiggest raylib update in 10 years\n. Many new features and improvements with a special focus on maintainabiliy and long-term sustainability.\nUndoubtely, this is the raylib of the future\n.\nEnjoy programming!\n:)\nNew

        "content": "One year after raylib 5.0 release, arribes\nraylib 5.5\n, the next big revision of the library. It's been\n11 years\nsince raylib 1.0 release and in all this time it has never stopped growing and improving. With an outstanding number of new contributors and improvements, it's, again, the biggest raylib release to date.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+270\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1810\n!)\n+800\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+7770\n!)\n+30\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n580\n!)\n+110\nfunctions REVIEWED with fixes and improvements\n+140\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n+640\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 5.5\n:\nNEW\nraylib pre-configured Windows package\n: The new raylib\nportable and self-contained Windows package\nfor\nraylib 5.5\n, intended for nobel devs that start in programming world, comes with one big addition: support for\nC code building for Web platform with one-single-mouse-click!\nFor the last 10 years, the pre-configured raylib Windows package allowed to edit simple C projects on Notepad++ and easely compile Windows executables with an automatic script; this new release adds the possibility to compile the same C projects for Web platform with a simple mouse click. This new addition\ngreatly simplifies C to WebAssembly project building for new users\n. The\nraylib Windows Installer\npackage can be downloaded for free from\nraylib on itch.io\n.\nNEW\nraylib project creator tool\n: A brand new tool developed to help raylib users to\nsetup new projects in a professional way\n.\nraylib project creator\ngenerates a complete project structure with\nmultiple build systems ready-to-use\nand\nGitHub CI/CD actions pre-configured\n. It only requires providing some C files and basic project parameters! The tools is\nfree and open-source\n, and\nit can be used online\n!.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: RGFW\n: Thanks to the\nrcore\nplatform-split implemented in\nraylib 5.0\n,\nadding new platforms backends has been greatly simplified\n, new backends can be added using provided template, self-contained in a single C module, completely portable. A new platform backend has been added:\nRGFW\n.\nRGFW\nis a\nnew single-file header-only portable library\n(\nRGFW.h\n) intended for platform-functionality management (windowing and inputs); in this case for\ndesktop platforms\n(Windows, Linux, macOS) but also for\nWeb platform\n. It adds a new alternative to the already existing\nGLFW\nand\nSDL\nplatform backends.\nNEW\nPlatform backend version supported: SDL3\n: Previous\nraylib 5.0\nadded support for\nSDL2\nlibrary, and\nraylib 5.5\nnot only improves SDL2 functionality, with several issues reviewed, but also adds support for the recently released big SDL update in years:\nSDL3\n. Now users can\nselect at compile time the desired SDL version to use\n, increasing the number of potential platforms supported in the future!\nNEW\nRetro-console platforms supported: Dreamcast, N64, PSP, PSVita, PS4\n: Thanks to the platform-split on\nraylib 5.0\n,\nsupporting new platform backends is easier than ever!\nAlong the raylib\nrlgl\nmodule support for the\nOpenGL 1.1\ngraphics API, it opened the door to\nmultiple homebrew retro-consoles backend implementations!\nIt's amazing to see raylib running on +20 year old consoles like\nDreamcast\n,\nPSP\nor\nPSVita\n, considering the hardware constraints of those platforms and proves\nraylib outstanding versability!\nThose additional platforms can be found in separate repositories and have been created by the amazing programmer Antonio Jose Ramos Marquez (\n@psxdev\n).\nNEW\nGPU Skinning support\n: After lots of requests for this feature, it has been finally added to raylib thanks to the contributor Daniel Holden (\n@orangeduck\n), probably the developer that has further pushed models animations with raylib, developing two amazing tools to visualize and test animations:\nGenoView\nand\nBVHView\n. Adding GPU skinning was a tricky feature, considering it had to be\navailable for all raylib supported platforms\n, including limited ones like Raspberry Pi with OpenGL ES 2.0, where some advance OpenGL features are not available (UBO, SSBO, Transform Feedback) but a multi-platform solution was found to make it possible. A new example,\nmodels_gpu_skinning\nhas been added to illustrate this new functionality. As an extra, previous existing CPU animation system has been greatly improved, multiplying performance by a factor (simplifiying required maths).\nNEW\nraymath\nC++ operators\n: After several requested for this feature, C++ math operators for\nVector2\n,\nVector3\n,\nVector4\n,\nQuaternion\nand\nMatrix\nhas been added to\nraymath\nas an extension to current implementation. Despite being only available for C++ because C does not support it, these operators\nsimplify C++ code when doing math operations\n.\nBeside those new big features,\nraylib 5.5\ncomes with MANY other improvements:\nNormals support on batching system\nClipboard images reading support\nCRC32/MD5/SHA1 hash computation\nGamepad vibration support\nImproved font loading (no GPU required) with BDF fonts support\nTime-based camera movement\nImproved GLTF animations loading\n...and\nmuch much more\n, including\nmany functions reviews and new functions added!\nMake sure to check raylib\nCHANGELOG\nfor a detailed list of changes!\nTo end with, I want to\nthank all the contributors (+640!\n) that along the years have\ngreatly improved raylib\nand pushed it further and better day after day. Thanks to all of them, raylib is the amazing library it is today.\nLast but not least, I want to thank\nraylib sponsors and all the raylib community\nfor their support and continuous engagement with the library, creating and sharing amazing raylib projects on a daily basis.\nThanks for making raylib a great platform to enjoy games/tools/graphic programming!\nAfter 11 years of development,\nraylib 5.5\nis the best raylib ever.\nEnjoy programming with raylib!\n:)\nNew Contributors\n@Kimo-s\nmade their first contribution in\n#3528\n@MrScautHD\nmade their first contribution
