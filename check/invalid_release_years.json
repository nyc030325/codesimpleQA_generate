Overall Improvements New Features and Improvements All affected JAR files now include native-image.properties files that contain the --initialize-at-build-time option to avoid breakages in GraalVM projects when updating to newer versions of JUnit. JUnit Platform Deprecations and Breaking Changes SearchOption and AnnotationSupport.findAnnotation(Class, Class, SearchOption) from junit-platform-commons have been deprecated. New Features and Improvements ConsoleLauncher now accepts multiple values for all --select options. ConsoleLauncher now supports a --select-unique-id option to select containers and tests by unique ID. ConsoleLauncher supports new --exclude-methodname and --include-methodname options to include or exclude methods based on fully qualified method names without parameters. For example, --exclude-methodname=^org\\.example\\..+#methodname will exclude all methods called methodName under package org.example. The --select-file and --select-resource options for the ConsoleLauncher now support line and column numbers. New ReflectionSupport.makeAccessible(Field) public utility method to be used by third parties instead of calling the internal ReflectionUtils.makeAccessible(Field) method directly. The ReflectionSupport.tryToLoadClass(…​) utility methods now support lookups for the void pseudo-type, which indirectly supports String to Class conversion for void in parameterized tests in JUnit Jupiter. New addResourceContainerSelectorResolver() method in EngineDiscoveryRequestResolver.Builder which supports the discovery of class path resource based tests, analogous to the existing addClassContainerSelectorResolver() method. New getOutputDirectoryProvider() method in EngineDiscoveryRequest and TestPlan to allow test engines to publish/attach files to containers and tests by calling EngineExecutionListener.fileEntryPublished(…​). Registered TestExecutionListeners can then access these files by overriding the fileEntryPublished(…​) method. The following improvements have been made to the Open Test Reporting XML output: Information about the Git repository, the current branch, the commit hash, and the current worktree status are now included in the XML report, if applicable. A section containing JUnit-specific metadata about each test/container to the HTML report is now written by open-test-reporting when added to the classpath/module path Information about published files is now included as attachments. If output capturing is enabled, the captured output written to System.out and System.err is now included in the XML report. Output written to System.out and System.err from non-test threads is now attributed to the most recent test or container that was started or has written output. New public interface ClasspathScanner allowing third parties to provide a custom implementation for scanning the classpath for classes and resources. New AnnotationSupport.findAnnotation(Class, Class, List) method to support searching for an annotation on an inner class and its runtime enclosing instance types. New TestDescriptor.orderChildren(UnaryOperator<List<TestDescriptor>> orderer) method to order children in place JUnit Jupiter Bug Fixes Provide runtime enclosing types of @Nested test classes and contained test methods to DisplayNameGenerator implementations. Prior to this change, such generators were only able to access the enclosing class in which @Nested was declared, but they could not access the concrete runtime type of the enclosing instance. @DisplayNameGeneration annotations are now discovered on the runtime enclosing types of @Nested test classes instead of the compile-time enclosing class in which the @Nested class was declared. Fix handling of junctions on Windows during @TempDir cleanup: junctions will no longer be followed when deleting directories and broken junctions will be deleted. Deprecations and Breaking Changes When injecting TestInfo into test class constructors, the TestInfo now contains data for the test method for which the test class instance is being created, unless the test instance lifecycle is set to PER_CLASS (in which case it continues to contain the data for the test class). If you require the TestInfo of the test class, you can implement a @BeforeAll lifecycle method and inject TestInfo into that method. When injecting TestReporter into test class constructors the published report entries are now associated with the test method rather than the test class, unless the test instance lifecycle is set to PER_CLASS (in which case the published report entries will continue to be associated with the test class). If you want to publish report entries for the test class, you can implement a @BeforeAll lifecycle method and inject TestReporter into that method. New Features and Improvements Kotlin contracts for Kotlin-specific assertion methods in Assertions. @TempDir is now supported on test class constructors. Shared resource locks may now be determined programmatically at runtime via the new @ResourceLock#providers attribute that accepts implementations of ResourceLocksProvider. Shared resource locks for direct child nodes may now be configured via the new @ResourceLock(target = CHILDREN) attribute. This may improve parallelization when a test class declares a READ lock, but only a few methods hold a READ_WRITE lock. @EnumSource has new from and to attributes that support the selection of enum constants within the specified range. In a @ParameterizedTest method, a null value can now be supplied for Java Date/Time types such as LocalDate if the new nullable attribute in @JavaTimeConversionPattern is set to true. The new @ParameterizedTest(allowZeroInvocations = true) attribute allows to specify that the absence of invocations is expected in some cases and should not cause a test failure. Parameterized tests now support argument count validation. If the junit.jupiter.params.argumentCountValidation=strict configuration parameter or the @ParameterizedTest(argumentCountValidation = STRICT) attribute is set, any mismatch between the declared number of arguments and the number of arguments provided by the arguments source will result in an error. By default, it is still only an error if there are fewer arguments provided than declared. ArgumentsProvider (declared via @ArgumentsSource), ArgumentConverter (declared via @ConvertWith), and ArgumentsAggregator (declared via @AggregateWith) implementations can now use constructor injection from registered ParameterResolver extensions. TestTemplateInvocationContextProvider extensions can now signal that they may potentially return zero invocation contexts by overriding the new mayReturnZeroTestTemplateInvocationContexts() method. Extensions that implement TestInstancePreConstructCallback, TestInstanceFactory, TestInstancePostProcessor, ParameterResolver, or InvocationInterceptor may override the getTestInstantiationExtensionContextScope() method to enable receiving a test-scoped ExtensionContext in Extension methods called during test class instantiation. This behavior will become the default in future versions of JUnit. The new PreInterruptCallback interface defines the API for Extensions that wish to be called prior to invocations of Thread#interrupt() by the @Timeout extension. When enabled via the junit.jupiter.execution.timeout.threaddump.enabled configuration parameter, an implementation of PreInterruptCallback is registered that writes a thread dump to System.out prior to interrupting a test thread due to a timeout. TestReporter now allows publishing files for a test method or test class which can be used to include them in test reports, such as the Open Test Reporting format. Auto-registered extensions can now be filtered using include and exclude patterns that can be specified as configuration parameters. JRE-based conditions such as @EnabledOnJre and @DisabledForJreRange now support arbitrary Java versions. See the User Guide for details. The @TempDir extension now warns during cleanup when deleting symlinks that target locations outside the temporary directory to signal that the target file or directory is not deleted, only the link to it. JUnit Vintage New Features and Improvements Added support for executing test classes and/or methods in parallel. Please refer to the User Guide for more information.",

Overall Improvements New Features and Improvements Java classes in published artifacts are now compiled with the -parameters option of javac and thus now contain metadata for reflection on parameters such as their names. JUnit Platform Bug Fixes Field and method search algorithms now adhere to standard Java semantics regarding whether a given field or method is visible or overridden according to the rules of the Java language. See the new Field and Method Search Semantics section of the User Guide for details. ReflectionSupport.findFields(…​) now returns a distinct set of fields. Fixed parsing of recursive jar URIs which allows the JUnit Platform Launcher to be used inside Spring Boot executable jars for Spring Boot 3.2 and later. The junit-platform-suite-engine now includes configuration provided via @ConfigurationParameter when selecting tests by UniqueId (backported to 5.10.3). In order to support using @EnabledInNativeImage on test classes, UniqueIdTrackingListener now tracks descendants of skipped test containers (backported to 5.10.3). Attempting to deserialize a TestIdentifier no longer causes a NullPointerException when there is no parent identifier. See issue 3819 (backported to 5.10.3). Deprecations and Breaking Changes As mentioned in the Bug Fixes section above, field and method search algorithms now adhere to standard Java semantics regarding whether a given field or method is visible or overridden according to the rules of the Java language. The changes in the search algorithms may, however, result in breaking changes for some use cases. In light of that, it is possible to revert to the previous \"legacy semantics\". See the new Field and Method Search Semantics section of the User Guide for details. New Features and Improvements New ConversionSupport utility in junit-platform-commons which exposes the conversion logic that was previously private to JUnit Jupiter’s @ParameterizedTest infrastructure — for use in third-party extensions and test engines. Error messages for type mismatches in NamespacedHierarchicalStore now include the actual type and value in addition to the required type. Updated open-test-reporting dependency to 0.1.0-M2. All Platform implementations of DiscoverySelector now have a parseable string representation that can be generated by calling the new DiscoverySelector.toIdentifier() method and toString() on the returned DiscoverySelectorIdentifier. This string representation can be used to reconstruct the original DiscoverySelector by calling the new DiscoverySelectors.parse() method. This change will allow build tools and IDEs to provide generic mechanisms for specifying selectors on the command line or in configuration files without having to support each selector type individually. The Console Launcher supports specifying selectors via their identifiers using the --select option. For example, --select class:foo.Bar will run all tests in the foo.Bar class. Similarly, the JUnit Platform Suite engine provides a new @Select(\"<identifier>\") annotation. The Console Launcher now provides a --version option. NamespacedHierarchicalStore now throws an IllegalStateException for any attempt to modify or query the store after it has been closed. In addition, an attempt to close a store that has already been closed will have no effect. See issue 3614 for details. Introduce @ConfigurationParametersResource for @Suite classes and --config-resource option for ConsoleLauncher that allow specifying additional properties files on the classpath as sources of configuration parameters. New rootCause() condition in TestExecutionResultConditions that matches if an exception’s root cause matches all supplied conditions, for use with the EngineTestKit. ReflectionSupport now supports scanning for classpath resources. Introduce @BeforeSuite and @AfterSuite lifecycle methods for @Suite classes. JUnit Jupiter Bug Fixes Due to changes in the JUnit Platform regarding field and method search algorithms (see Bug Fixes above), numerous bugs have been addressed within JUnit Jupiter, including but not limited to the following. Two @TempDir fields with the same name in a superclass and subclass will now both be injected. Two @Test methods with the same signature in a superclass and subclass will now both be invoked, as long as the @Test method in the subclass does not override the @Test method in the superclass, which can occur if the superclass method is private or if the superclass method is package-private and resides in a different package than the subclass. The same applies to other types of test methods (@TestFactory, @ParameterizedTest, etc.) as well as lifecycle methods (@BeforeAll, @AfterAll, @BeforeEach, and @AfterEach). MethodOrderer.Random and ClassOrderer.Random now use the same default seed that is generated during class initialization (backported to 5.10.3). TestInstancePostProcessor extensions can now be registered via the @ExtendWith annotation on non-static fields. Methods and constructors invoked via ExecutableInvoker now use the same extensions as the context they are invoked from and the same ExtensionContext is passed to registered instances of ParameterResolver. The org.junit.jupiter.api.extension.support package is now exported from the org.junit.jupiter.api module Deprecations and Breaking Changes The registration order of extensions was changed to allow non-static fields to be processed earlier. This change may affect extensions that rely on the order of registration. Kotlin support now depends on Kotlin API and language version 1.6; whereas, it previously depended on version 1.3. New Features and Improvements New @FieldSource annotation for use with @ParameterizedTest methods which allows you to source arguments from a local field or an external field referenced by fully qualified field name. This feature is similar to the existing @MethodSource feature. See the User Guide for details. New @AutoClose annotation that can be applied to fields within tests to automatically close the annotated resource after test execution. See the User Guide for details. JAVA_23 and JAVA_24 have been added to the JRE enum for use with JRE-based execution conditions. New Exception Handling documentation in the User Guide. Improved documentation for Assumptions in the User Guide. Improved Javadoc for assertThrows() and assertThrowsExactly() to make it clear that the supplied message is not the expected message of the thrown exception. Improved documentation for semantics of a disabled test regarding class-level lifecycle methods and callbacks. @..Source annotations for parameterized tests can now be used as repeatable annotations. See the User Guide for details. New argumentSet() factory method for providing a custom name for an entire set of arguments for a @ParameterizedTest. See the User Guide for details. New assertInstanceOf methods added for Kotlin following up with similar Java assertInstanceOf methods introduced in 5.8 version. New generators in DynamicTest that take a Stream/Iterator of Named<Executable> along with a convenient NamedExecutable interface that can simplify writing dynamic tests, in particular in recent versions of Java that support records. @TempDir now suppresses NoSuchFileException when attempting to delete files that may have been already deleted by another thread or process. @TempDir now fails fast in case TempDirFactory::createTempDirectory returns null, a file, or a symbolic link to a file. @TempDir now fails fast in case the annotated target is of type File and TempDirFactory::createTempDirectory returns a Path that does not belong to the default file system. Allow potentially unlimited characters per column in @CsvSource and @CsvFileSource by specifying maxCharsPerColumn = -1. JUnit Vintage No changes.",

New TempDirFactory SPI for customizing how temporary directories are created Failure threshold for @RepeatedTest New convenience base classes for implementing ArgumentsProvider and ArgumentConverter Custom class loader support for class/method selectors, @MethodSource, @EnabledIf, and @DisabledIf Improved configurability of parallel execution Numerous bug fixes and minor improvements For a complete list of all closed issues and pull requests for this release, consult the 5.10.0-M1, 5.10.0-RC1, 5.10.0-RC2, and 5.10.0 GA milestone pages in the JUnit repository on GitHub. JUnit Platform Deprecations and Breaking Changes Building native images with GraalVM now requires configuring the build arg --initialize-at-build-time=org.junit.platform.launcher.core.LauncherConfig and --initialize-at-build-time=org.junit.jupiter.engine.config.InstantiatingConfigurationParameterConverter. The getMethodParameterTypes() methods in MethodSelector and NestedMethodSelector have been deprecated and replaced by getParameterTypeNames() for greater clarity. New Features and Improvements Various experimental APIs have been promoted to stable, including ModuleSelector, EngineDiscoveryListener, EngineDiscoveryRequestResolver, LauncherSession, LauncherSessionListener, parallel execution support classes, @Suite and related annotations, and others. All utility methods in ReflectionSupport that return a List now have counterparts which return a Stream. New tryToLoadClass(…​) variant in ReflectionSupport that accepts an explicit ClassLoader, allowing classes to be resolved with custom ClassLoader arrangements. ReflectionSupport.findMethod(Class<?>, String, String) now uses the ClassLoader of the supplied Class to load parameter types instead of using the default ClassLoader. This allows parameter types to be resolved with custom ClassLoader arrangements (such as OSGi). Consequently, DiscoverySelectors.selectMethod(Class<?>, String, String) also now works properly with custom ClassLoader arrangements. New @SelectMethod selector support in the @Suite test engine. Classes may now be selected by fully-qualified name via the names attribute in @SelectClasses. New overloaded constructors for ClassSelector, NestedClassSelector, MethodSelector, and NestedMethodSelector that take an explicit ClassLoader as a parameter, allowing selectors to select classes in custom ClassLoader arrangements like in OSGi. New selectMethod() and selectNestedMethod() variants in DiscoverySelectors that accept a Class<?>…​ argument of parameter types as a type-safe alternative to providing the names of parameter types as a comma-delimited string. For consistency with JUnit Jupiter lifecycle callbacks, listener method pairs for started/finished and opened/closed events are now invoked using wrapping semantics. This means that finished/closed event methods are invoked in reverse order compared to the corresponding started/opened event methods when multiple listeners are registered. This affects the following listener interfaces: TestExecutionListener, EngineExecutionListener, LauncherDiscoveryListener, and LauncherSessionListener. New LauncherInterceptor SPI for intercepting the creation of instances of Launcher and LauncherSessionlistener as well as invocations of the discover and execute methods of the former. Please refer to the User Guide for details. Support for limiting the max-pool-size-factor for parallel execution via a configuration parameter. New testfeed details mode for ConsoleLauncher that prints test execution events as they occur in a concise format. The existing functionality of the ConsoleLauncher has been split into two subcommands: execute for executing tests and engines for listing registered test engines. A new discover subcommand has been added to the ConsoleLauncher to print the discovered tests for the specified details mode without executing them. Improved error message for cyclic graphs detected during test discovery to be more actionable. Extracted NamespacedHierarchicalStore from JUnit Jupiter engine for reuse by other test engines and their extensions. New dry-run mode to simulate test execution without actually running tests. Please refer to the User Guide for details. Stack traces produced by failing tests are now pruned of calls from the org.junit, jdk.internal.reflect, and sun.reflect packages. This feature can be disabled via a configuration parameter. Please refer to the User Guide for details. New getAncestors() method in TestDescriptor. JUnit Jupiter Bug Fixes The extensions supporting @MethodSource, @EnabledIf, and @DisabledIf now load classes by fully-qualified class name using the ClassLoader obtained from the test class when possible. This allows classes to be resolved with custom ClassLoader arrangements (such as OSGi). When converting an argument for a @ParameterizedTest method from a fully-qualified class name (String) to a Class, the ClassLoader of the class in which the @ParameterizedTest method is declared is now used to resolve the Class instead of the default ClassLoader. Deprecations and Breaking Changes The dynamic parallel execution strategy now allows the thread pool to be saturated by default. Implicit type conversion of boolean values like in @CsvSource is now stricter, only allowing values true or false (case-insensitive), in order to make accidental mistakes apparent and to avoid potential confusion. New Features and Improvements Various experimental APIs have been promoted to stable, including MethodOrderer, ClassOrderer, InvocationInterceptor, LifecycleMethodExecutionExceptionHandler, @TempDir, parallel execution annotations, and others. JAVA_22 has been added to the JRE enum for use with JRE-based execution conditions. New reason attribute in @Execution which can be used to document the reason for using the selected execution mode. New junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.max-pool-size-factor configuration parameter to set the maximum pool size factor. New junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.config.dynamic.saturate configuration parameter to disable pool saturation. @RepeatedTest can now be configured with a failure threshold which signifies the number of failures after which remaining repetitions will be automatically skipped. See the User Guide for details. If @MethodSource is used with a non-static factory method that should be static, the exception thrown now provides the user a meaningful explanation of how to address the problem. @EmptySource now supports additional types, including Collection and Map subtypes with a public no-arg constructor. New ArgumentsAccessor.getInvocationIndex() method that supplies the index of a @ParameterizedTest invocation. New AnnotationBasedArgumentsProvider convenience base class which implements both ArgumentsProvider and AnnotationConsumer. New AnnotationBasedArgumentConverter convenience base class which implements both ArgumentConverter and AnnotationConsumer. @TempDir can now be used as a meta-annotation in order to create custom composed annotations. See the @JimfsTempDir example in the User Guide for details. @TempDir now successfully cleans up files and directories on Windows that are set to read-only. New TempDirFactory SPI for customizing how the @TempDir extension creates temporary directories. See the User Guide for details. The User Guide now includes an example implementation of the RandomNumberExtension in order to improve the documentation for extension registration via @ExtendWith on fields. The scope of applicability for TestWatcher implementations is now more extensively documented in the User Guide and Javadoc. DisplayNameGenerator methods are now allowed to return null, in order to signal to fall back to the default display name generator. JUnit Vintage No changes.",

If contribution needs special formatting such as annotations or specific javadocs that conflict with formatting rules, use\n// @formatter:off\nand\n// @formatter:on\naround block of code to be ignored on formatting.  If within a javadoc, since its a comment type, the entire thing is affected so just wrap this around the entire javadoc.  Try to ensure code inside the non formatting block is appropriately formatted otherwise to ease readability.\nWhat's Changed\nUpdate junit5 monorepo to v5.9.1 by\n@renovate\nin\n#2702\nUpdate

Code is still java 8 compatible at this time.\nUpdate vulnerable hsqldb to 2.7.2 fixing our tests that now work due to newer support.  Note, users were never affected by this but at least one user pull request was attempted opened in addition to both renovate and dependabot and various reporting on it.\nNow using more properties to define versions in pom to lower the frequency of pull requests from renovate\nSite\nWe have moved to maven site 4.0.0 using site xsd 2.0.0.  This resulted in us needing to turn off the PDF documentation of our site.  Please just use our site pages for now.\nDue to site changes, if anyone finds any issues, please be sure to report them as the upgrade path with maven has been disappointing at best.  We believe we got all setup correctly but will fix anything as quickly as discovered problematic.  We apologize in advance of this situation as we work through maven 4 site changes.",

These are not technically compliant with the HTTP specification, but are often supported or required by services.\nPublish a BOM of all modules. The Maven coordinates are\ncom.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit-bom\n.\nInvocation\nnow exposes the service\nClass<?>\nand the instance on which the method was invoked. This disambiguates the source when service inheritence is used.\nA response type keeper annotation processor is now available for generating shrinker rules for all referenced types in your service interface. In some cases, it's impossible for static shrinker rules to keep the entirety of what Retrofit needs at runtime. This annotation processor generates those additional rules. For more info see\nits README\n.\nChanged\nAdd shrinker rules to retain the generic signatures of built-in types (\nCall\n,\nResponse\n, etc.) which are used via reflection at runtime.\nRemove backpressure support from RxJava 2 and 3 adapters. Since we only deliver a single value and the Reactive Streams specification states that callers must request a non-zero subscription value, we never need to honor backpressure.\nKotlin\nRetrofit.create\nfunction now has a non-null lower bound. Even if you specified a nullable type before this function would never return null.\nSuspend functions now capture and defer all\nThrowable\nsubtypes (not just\nException\nsubtypes) to avoid Java's\nUndeclaredThrowableException\nwhen thrown synchronously.\nEagerly reject\nsuspend fun\nfunctions that return\nCall<Body>\n. These are never correct, and should declare a return type of\nBody\ndirectly.\nSupport for Java 14-specific and Java 16-specific reflection needed to invoke default methods on interfaces have been moved to separate versions of a class through a multi-release jar. This should have no observable impact other than the jar now contains classes which target Java 14 and Java 16 bytecode that might trip up some static analysis tools which are not aware of multi-release jars.\nParameter names are now displayed in exception messages when available in the underlying Java bytecode.\nJackson converter now supports binary formats by using byte streams rather than character streams in its implementation. Use the\ncreate(ObjectMapper, MediaType)\noverload to supply the value of the\nContent-Type\nheader for your format.\nFixed\nDo not include synthetic methods when doing eager validation.\nUse per-method rather than per-class locking when parsing annotations. This eliminates contention when multiple calls are made in quick succession at the beginning of the process lifetime.",

However, this lead to some problems in multi mapping methods. Therefore, in this release we tightened up a bit and in multi source mapping methods the Map will not be considered when doing implicit mappings.\ne.g.\n@Mapper\npublic interface CarMapper {\n\n    // This method is going to implicitly map all the target properties from the map\n    Target map(Map<String, Object> map);\n    \n    // This method is not going to use the map for implicit mappings.\n    //  Only the name will be mapped from the map (since it has been defined like that\n    @Mapping(target = \"name\", source = \"map.name\")\n    Target map(Source source, Map<String, Object> map)\n\n}\n@BeanMapping\ninheritance\nAll, except\nresultType\nand\nignoredUnmappedSourceProperties\nattributes of\n@BeanMapping\nhave been made to consistently be passed down to the generated nested methods. This means that if you were relying on some buggy behavior it might no longer work.\ne.g.\nBeanMapping#ignoreByDefault\nwas not being passed down properly, i.e. implicit mapping was being done for nested properties. This has been fixed. If you want to implicitly map nested mappings then you'll have to define your own mapper appropriatelly.\n@\nMapper\ninterface\nMyMapper\n{\n@\nBeanMapping\n(\nignoreByDefault\n=\ntrue\n)\n@\nMapping\n(\nsource\n=\n\"sub\"\n,\ntarget\n=\n\"target\"\n)\nTarget\nmap\n(\nSource\nsource\n);\n}\nneeds to be replaced with\n@\nMapper\ninterface\nMyMapper\n{\n@\nBeanMapping\n(\nignoreByDefault\n=\ntrue\n)\n@\nMapping\n(\nsource\n=\n\"sub\"\n,\ntarget\n=\n\"target\"\n)\nTarget\nmap\n(\nSource\nsource\n);\n// this is the mapping `source = \"sub\"` and `target = \"target\"`\n// redefined to get rid of the `ignoreByDefault=true`, because this property is inherited\nSubTarget\nsubSourceToSubTarget\n(\nSubSource\nsubSource\n);\n}\nSponsoring\nAfter the request from the community we have enabled sponsoring for the project. See\n#2340\nfor how you can sponsor us if you want to.\nContributors\n@anton-erofeev\n@Blackbaud-JasonBodnar\n@Bragolgirith\n@chenzijia12300\n@eroznik\n@EvaristeGalois11\n@ivlcic\n@jccampanero\n@kooixh\n@MengxingYuan\n@MLNW\n@Nikolas-Charalambidis\n@paparadva\n@prasanth08\n@ro0sterjam\n@rgdoliveira\n@venkatesh2090",
