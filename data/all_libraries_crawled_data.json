Unfortunately, there has never been a standard schema for the JUnit XML format. Common consumers of Clover XML log files interpret these files differently, which has led to frequent problems.\nTo address this, the JUnit team started the\nOpen Test Reporting project\n, creating and maintaining language-agnostic XML and HTML test reporting formats. Unlike JUnit XML, Open Test Reporting's XML formats are extensible.\nLogging in the Open Test Reporting XML format is controlled by the new\n--log-otr\nCLI option and the new\n<otr>\nXML configuration element.\nThis feature is experimental and the generated XML may change in order to enhance compliance with the Open Test Reporting project's XML schema definitions.

Unfortunately, there has never been a standard schema for the Clover XML format. Common consumers of Clover XML log files interpret these files differently, which leads to frequent problems.\nThe original commercial Clover project has been superseded by the Open Source OpenClover project, which provides an XML schema for its OpenClover XML format. Rather than modifying the existing Clover XML reporter to comply with the OpenClover XML schema, thereby breaking backward compatibility, a new OpenClover XML reporter has been introduced.\nThis new reporter is controlled by the new CLI option,\n--coverage-openclover\n, and the new XML configuration element,\n<openclover>\n. This code coverage reporter generates XML documents that validate against the OpenClover project's XML schema definition, with one exception: the\n<testproject>\nelement is not generated.\nThe existing Clover XML reporter, controlled by the\n--coverage-clover\nCLI option and the\n<clover>\nXML configuration element, remains unchanged.\nThis feature is experimental and the generated XML may change to enhance compliance with the OpenClover XML schema definition.

    "version": "v6.1.0",
    "title": "Release v6.1.0 · swoole/swoole-src · GitHub",
    "release_date": "2025-10-24T12:42:40Z",
    "content": "Major Changes in Swoole 6.1.0\n1. Introduction of \"Standard Library Extensions\" - Revolutionary Syntax Enhancements\nThis is the most eye-catching feature at the language level in this update, allowing object-oriented operations on basic types.\nObject-Oriented Basic Types\n: Methods can be called directly on variables of basic types like\nstring\n,\narray\n, and\nstream\n(e.g.,\n$text->length()->lower()\n), greatly improving code readability and development experience.\nTyped Arrays\n: Introduced the\ntyped_array\nsyntax, allowing constraints on key and value types (e.g.,\n<int, string>\n), with type checks performed on write operations, enhancing code robustness.\n2. A Major Leap in Underlying Architecture and Stability\nThis version invests heavily in code quality and stability, laying a solid foundation for future development.\nSignificant Increase in Test Coverage to 86%\n: By systematically adding test cases, potential errors are greatly reduced, improving the overall reliability and maintainability of the project.\nLarge-Scale Code Refactoring and Static Analysis\n: Refactored multiple core modules like Reactor, SSL, and Socket, and used\nclang-tidy\nfor code standardization, significantly improving code quality and performance.\n3. Major Simplification and Unification of the Lock API\nA groundbreaking refactoring of the core component for concurrent programming – the lock.\nAPI Simplification\n: Removed methods like\nlockwait\nand\ntrylock\n, retaining only three core methods –\n__construct\n,\nlock\n, and\nunlock\n– for\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Lock\n,\nSwoole\\Lock\n, and\nSwoole\\Thread\\Lock\n.\nUnified Behavior\n: The new API design is closer to PHP's native\nflock\nfunction, reducing the learning curve, and uses standard constants like\nLOCK_EX | LOCK_NB\nto implement advanced features such as non-blocking.\n4. Enhanced Coroutine Capabilities and Fine-Grained Control\nMore flexible coroutine operation capabilities.\nCoroutine Cancellation Mechanism\n:\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\nnow includes a\n$throw_exception\nparameter, allowing a catchable\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\CanceledException\nto be thrown into the target coroutine upon cancellation, enabling safer and more controllable coroutine lifecycle management.\nCoroutine State Isolation for Serialization Operations\n: Fixed the issue of global state isolation for serialize/unserialize in coroutine environments. Global variables related to serialization are now automatically saved and restored during coroutine switches, ensuring isolated serialization contexts for each coroutine.\n5. Default HTTP Parser Upgrade, Websocket Feature Enhancements, and Platform Compatibility Improvements\nImportant improvements in performance and compatibility.\nllHTTP Enabled by Default\n: Replaced the old\nhttp_parser\nwith the more performant and modern\nllhttp\n, improving the efficiency and reliability of HTTP processing.\nWebSocket Feature Enhancements\n: Both client and server now support receiving fragmented messages, actively disconnecting (\ndisconnect\n), and sending Ping frames (\nping\n), making the WebSocket protocol implementation more complete.\nDeprecating Select, Embracing Poll\n: Completely deprecated the flawed\nselect\nevent mechanism. On platforms that do not support\nepoll/kqueue\n(like Cygwin),\npoll\nis now used by default, enabling support for a large number of concurrent connections on these platforms as well.\n🎉\nStandard Library Extensions\nSwoole-Cli version\n6.1\nwill add\nPHP\nstandard library extension syntax, providing some additional new syntax while maintaining full compatibility with the official\nPHP\nsyntax. These new extension syntaxes are all optional and do not affect existing\nPHP\ncode. The standard library extension syntax will be implemented in the\nstdext\nmodule of\next-swoole\n.\nswoole-cli\nusers can use it directly without any additional parameters.\next-swoole\nusers need to add\n--enable-swoole-stdext\nduring compilation to enable it.\nstdext\ncan be used in\nphp-cli\n,\nphp-fpm\n,\ncli-http-server\n, and\nswoole\nmodes.\n1. Object-Oriented Basic Types\nVersion\n6.1\nimplements object-oriented encapsulation of\narray\n,\nstring\n, and\nstream\nbasic types, supporting method calls in an object-oriented style. Methods can be called directly on variables of these types.\nThe built-in methods for basic types actually still call the\nPHP\nstandard library implementations. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the built-in methods and PHP's\nstr_\nor\narray_\nseries of functions. For example,\n$text->replace()\ncorresponds to the\nstr_replace\nfunction. The underlying layer only adjusts the function names, the parameter order for a few methods, and the parameter and return value types for a couple of methods. Please refer to the\nSwoole Documentation\nfor details.\n$\ntext\n=\n'\nHello Swoole\n'\n;\nvar_dump\n(\n$\ntext\n->\nlength\n());\necho\n$\ntext\n->\nlower\n()->\nreplace\n(\n\"\nswoole\n\"\n,\n\"\nphp\n\"\n);\necho\nfopen\n(\n\"\n/tmp/test.log\n\"\n)->\nread\n(\n1024\n);\n2. Typed-Array Strongly Typed Arrays\nAllows restricting array types, such as\nMap\nor\nArrayList\n, and restricting the types of\nkey\nand\nvalue\n. Supports multi-level nested formats. A\ntyped array\nis still essentially an\narray\ntype; the underlying layer only performs parameter checks on write operations. A\ntyped array\ncan be passed as an\narray\nto other functions or class methods.\n$\narray\n=\ntyped_array\n(\n'\n<int, string>\n'\n);\n$\narray\n[\n1000\n] =\n\"\nhello\n\"\n;\n// Correct\n$\narray\n[\n2000\n] =\n2025\n;\n// Error, throws an exception\n✨\nNew Features\nllHTTP Default Parser\n: Starting from v6.1.0, Swoole uses the more performant\nllhttp\ninstead of\nhttp_parser\nas the default HTTP message parser.\nCoroutine-based File Download\n:\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\nnow supports complete coroutine-based file download operations.\nAsynchronous File Truncation\n: Added\niouring ftruncate\nsupport, expanding asynchronous file operation capabilities.\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\nadds a\n$throw_exception\nparameter, supporting throwing an exception when canceling a coroutine.\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\nand\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\nnow support receiving WebSocket fragmented messages.\nAdded\ndisconnect\nand\nping\nmethods for\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\nand\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n.\nRefactored\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Lock\n,\nSwoole\\Lock\n, and\nSwoole\\Thread\\Lock\n, retaining only the\n__construct\n,\nlock\n, and\nunlock\nmethods, making usage closer to\nphp flock\n.\n🐛\nBug Fixes\nThread Mode Optimization\n:\nFixed the issue where\nhook_flags\nsettings became ineffective in\nSWOOLE_THREAD\nmode.\nFixed the issue where the heartbeat thread held invalid pointers and accessed freed memory after worker threads restarted due to reaching the\nmax_request\nlimit.\nFixed the issue of not supporting restarting\nTask\nprocesses individually.\nFixed an issue where\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server\nmight still trigger the\nonMessage\ncallback after a handshake failure or connection closure.\nFixed execution errors in\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\ncaused by inconsistencies between function return value types and signatures.\nFixed the issue where\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\ndid not support enabling HTTP/2.\nFixed the timeout precision conversion issue in\nSwoole\\Lock::lockwait()\n.\nFixed the issue causing\nReactorEpoll::add(): failed to add event\nwarnings when using the coroutine-based\ncurl\nmodule, due to\nPHP 8\ncompatibility adjustments and incomplete cleanup of\nkeepalive\nconnections.\nFixed the issue where\nSwoole\\Server::taskWaitMulti()\ncould not be used in multi-threaded mode.\nFixed resource competition issues in\nSwoole\\Server::taskCo()\nin multi-threaded mode.\nStability Improvements\n:\nFixed the issue where synchronous processes (including manager and task processes) could not normally use\nprocess::signal()\n.\nCorrected the resource cleanup mechanism when worker processes exit abnormally.\nResolved compilation failure issues on the Cygwin platform.\nFixed the issue where curl with keepalive enabled could not reuse sockets.\nImproved the log component to resolve data consistency issues in multi-threaded mode.\nFixed the compilation failure of the\nio_uring\nfutex\nfeature on\nubuntu24.04\n.\nFixed the compilation failure on older Linux systems due to struct order assignment.\nFixed the uninitialized\nid\nproperty issue for directly instantiated\nSwoole\\Process\nobjects.\nFixed the missing\n--enable-zstd\noption in composer.json when compiling swoole with\nPIE\n.\nFixed the issue where\nworker\nprocesses could not send signals to the\nmanager\nprocess due to insufficient permissions after specifying a user group.\nCompatibility Improvements\n:\nFixed compatibility issues with\nphp_swoole_register_shutdown_function\nunder PHP 8.5.\nCorrected the handling of null parameters in\nSwoole\\Table::get()\n.\nProtocol Handling\n:\nOptimized the handling mechanism for duplicate fields in HTTP request and response headers to ensure correct merging.\nFixed the issue where processing a client\nAccept-Encoding: zlib\nrequest header would trigger an unknown compression method warning when the system lacked\nzlib\n.\n❌️\nDeprecations\nNo longer supports the\nselect\nevent mechanism.\nselect\nonly supports event monitoring for up to\n1024\nfile descriptors and has serious flaws. On platforms that do not support\nepoll/kqueue\n,\npoll\nwill be used as the event polling mechanism, allowing the\nCygwin\nplatform to also support a large number of concurrent connections.\nIn the\nSwoole\\Server::stop()\nmethod, the second parameter\n$waitEvent\nhas been deprecated; please use the\nreload_async\nparameter instead.\n🛠️\nArchitectural Optimizations\nVersion\n6.1\nadds a large number of unit tests for core modules, increasing test coverage to\n86%\n. By systematically supplementing test cases and refactoring underlying code logic, combined with full static code analysis using the\nclang-tidy\ntoolchain, automated code formatting and redundancy cleanup have been achieved, significantly improving code readability and maintainability.\nOptimized the underlying\nSSL\nmodule.\nOptimized the underlying\nSocket\nmodule.\nRefactored the underlying synchronous signal module.\nRefactored the underlying\nreactor\nand\nstring\nmodules.\nRefactored the underlying dynamic reloading of log files based on\nSIGRTMIN\nsignals.\nOptimized the underlying static file server, removing C-style code and unifying it into C++ style code.\nOptimized thread initialization logic, improved multi-threading performance, independently managed structure memory, eliminating the need for locking during thread creation and exit.\nRemoved the\nsocket_dontwait\noption in the underlying\nasync\nmodule, as it was deprecated.\nImproved test coverage for\nWebSocket\nmask handling.\nOptimized the\nsendfile\nfunctionality; the\ntcp_cork\noption is not set when the file is smaller than\n64KB\n.\nAdded unit tests for\naarch64\nand\nmacOS\nenvironments.\nOptimized underlying client network address resolution and settings.\nAdded\nssl_cafile/ssl_capath\nconfiguration items for the\nServer\nmodule.\nAdded the\nprint_backtrace_on_error\nconfiguration, which can print C function stack traces when unknown errors occur.\nAdded the\nAddress Sanitizer\ndebugging tool.\nAdded\nCygwin\ntesting, significantly improving compatibility and stability on the\nCygwin\nplatform.\nIn\nmacOS\nsystems, because the\nkqueue\nevent mechanism does not support cross-process pipe event monitoring, it is impossible to use\nSWOOLE_PROCESS\nmode and\nTask\nprocess features. Therefore, the system will default to using\npoll\nas the underlying event mechanism. If you need to enable\nkqueue\n, you can manually enable it via the\nSwoole\\Server::set(['enable_kqueue' => true])\nand\nswoole_async_set(['enable_kqueue' => true])\nmethods.\nUpgraded the\nSwoole library\nversion.\nDisabled the\n-Wdate-time\nwarning to resolve errors when compiling with Zig/Clang.\nRemoved PHP 8.0 related compatibility code.\nAdded the\nSWOOLE_ODBC_LIBS\nvariable in\nconfig.m4\n.\nEnsured that\ntimespec.tv_nsec\nvalues are less than\n1,000,000,000\nto comply with POSIX standard specifications.\nRefactored the underlying code for\nswoole\ncoroutine-based\ncurl\nto improve compatibility with the synchronous blocking version.\n⚠️\nNotes\nStarting from Swoole 6.1,\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\nand\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\nwill automatically handle WebSocket control frames unless\nopen_websocket_ping_frame\n,\nopen_websocket_pong_frame\n, or\nopen_websocket_close_frame\nare explicitly set.\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\ncannot cancel file coroutine operations; forcing cancellation may cause segmentation faults.\nIf\n--enable-iouring\nis enabled, a warning will be thrown if the kernel version or\nliburing\nversion does not meet the requirements.\nThe\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server::push\nmethod does not automatically close the connection after sending a close frame. To close the connection, please use the\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server::disconnect()\nmethod.\nWhen processing control frames, the\nSwoole\nprotocol actively sets the FIN flag to 1 and ensures compression is not enabled (i.e., the RSV1 bit is 0). User settings for this will be ignored.\nWhen handling compression and sending of consecutive frames,\nSwoole\ndelegates the responsibility of compression and data chunking to the application layer. Users need to manually implement the relevant logic. See the example at the end.\nThe system has automatically enabled the\nHTTP 100 Continue\nresponse feature by default.\nDuring coroutine switches, global variables related to\nserialize\nand\nunsealize\noperations will be saved and restored.\n💡\nAPI Changes\nNew Lock API\nFunction Prototypes\nnamespace\nSwoole\n\\\nCoroutine\n{\nclass\nLock

Wishing all friends in the open-source community good health, success in all your endeavors, and smooth work.\nSwoole 6.1.0 最大的几个变更\n1. 引入“标准库扩展” - 革命性的语法增强\n这是本次更新在语言层面最引人注目的特性，它允许以面向对象的方式操作基础类型。\n基础类型对象化\n：可以直接对\nstring\n、\narray\n、\nstream\n等基础类型的变量调用方法（如\n$text->length()->lower()\n），这极大地提升了代码的可读性和编写体验。\n强类型数组\n：引入了\ntyped_array\n语法，可以定义键值类型的约束（如\n<int, string>\n），在写入时进行类型检查，增强了代码的健壮性。\n2. 底层架构与稳定性的巨大飞跃\n本次版本在代码质量和稳定性上投入巨大，为未来的发展奠定了坚实基础。\n测试覆盖率大幅提升至86%\n：通过系统性地补充测试用例，极大地减少了潜在的错误，提高了整个项目的可靠性和可维护性。\n大规模代码重构与静态分析\n：重构了 Reactor、SSL、Socket 等多个核心模块，并使用\nclang-tidy\n进行代码规整，显著提升了代码质量和性能。\n3. 锁 API 的重大简化与统一\n对并发编程的核心组件——锁，进行了颠覆性的重构。\nAPI 精简\n：移除了\nlockwait\n、\ntrylock\n等方法，只为\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Lock\n、\nSwoole\\Lock\n和\nSwoole\\Thread\\Lock\n保留\n__construct\n、\nlock\n和\nunlock\n三个核心方法。\n行为统一\n：新的 API 设计更贴近 PHP 原生的\nflock\n函数，降低了学习成本，并使用\nLOCK_EX | LOCK_NB\n等标准常量来实现非阻塞等高级功能。\n4. 协程能力的强化与精细化控制\n更加灵活的协程操作能力。\n协程取消机制\n：\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\n新增\n$throw_exception\n参数，允许在取消协程时向目标协程内抛出一个可捕获的\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\CanceledException\n，实现了更安全、更可控的协程生命周期管理。\n实现序列化操作的协程状态隔离\n：修复协程环境下 serialize/unserialize 的全局状态隔离问题。现已在协程切换时自动保存和恢复相关全局变量，确保各协程序列化上下文互不干扰。\n5. 默认 HTTP 解析器升级，Websocket功能增强和平台兼容性改进\n在性能和兼容性方面的重要提升。\n默认启用 llHTTP\n：用性能更优、更现代的\nllhttp\n替代了旧的\nhttp_parser\n，提升了 HTTP 处理的效率和可靠性。\nWebSocket 功能增强\n：客户端和服务端均支持了接收分块消息、主动断开连接(\ndisconnect\n)和发送 Ping 帧(\nping\n)等能力，使 WebSocket 协议的实现更加完整。\n废弃 Select，拥抱 Poll\n：彻底废弃了有严重缺陷的\nselect\n事件机制，在不支持\nepoll/kqueue\n的平台上（如 Cygwin）默认使用\npoll\n，从而在这些平台上也能支持大量并发连接。\n🎉\n标准库扩展\n6.1\n版本\nSwoole-Cli\n将增加\nPHP\n标准库扩展语法，在保持对\nPHP\n官方语法完整兼容的同时，提供一些额外的新语法。这些新的扩展语法均是可选的，不影响现有的\nPHP\n代码。标准库扩展语法将在\next-swoole\n的\nstdext\n模块中实现。\nswoole-cli\n用户，可直接使用，无需设置任何额外的参数\next-swoole\n的用户，需在编译时添加\n--enable-swoole-stdext\n来启用\nstdext\n在\nphp-cli\n、\nphp-fpm\n、\ncli-http-server\n、\nswoole\n模式均可使用\n1. 基础类型对象化\n6.1\n版本实现了\narray\n/\nstring\n/\nstream\n基础类型的对象化封装，支持面向对象风格的方法调用，可直接对这些类型的变量调用内置方法。\n基础类型的内置方法实际上仍然是调用\nPHP\n标准库实现的，内置方法与\nPHP\n的\nstr_\n或\narray_\n系列函数是一一对应关系，例如\n$text->replace()\n对应的函数是\nstr_replace\n。底层仅调整了函数名称，少量方法调整了参数顺序，还有几个方法调整了参数和返回值类型，详情请查看\nSwoole 文档\n。\n$\ntext\n=\n'\nHello Swoole\n'\n;\nvar_dump\n(\n$\ntext\n->\nlength\n());\necho\n$\ntext\n->\nlower\n()->\nreplace\n(\n\"\nswoole\n\"\n,\n\"\nphp\n\"\n);\necho\nfopen\n(\n\"\n/tmp/test.log\n\"\n)->\nread\n(\n1024\n);\n2. Typed-Array 强类型数组\n可限制数组类型，如：\nMap\n或\nArrayList\n，以及限制\nkey\n与\nvalue\n的类型。支持多层嵌套格式。\ntyped array\n实际上依然是\narray\n类型，底层仅在写入时进行参数检查。\ntyped array\n可作为\narray\n传递给其他函数或类方法。\n$\narray\n=\ntyped_array\n(\n'\n<int, string>\n'\n);\n$\narray\n[\n1000\n] =\n\"\nhello\n\"\n;\n// 正确\n$\narray\n[\n2000\n] =\n2025\n;\n// 错误，抛出异常\n✨\n新特性\nllHTTP 默认解析器\n：自 v6.1.0 起，Swoole 采用性能更优的\nllhttp\n替代\nhttp_parser\n作为默认 HTTP 报文解析器。\n协程化文件下载\n：\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\n现支持完整的协程化文件下载操作。\n异步文件截断\n：新增\niouring ftruncate\n支持，扩展异步文件操作能力。\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\n新增\n$throw_exception\n参数，支持在取消协程时抛出异常。\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\n与\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n现已支持接收 WebSocket 分块消息。\n为\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\n和\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n新增\ndisconnect\n与\nping\n方法。\n重构\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Lock\n，\nSwoole\\Lock\n和，\nSwoole\\Thread\\Lock\n，只保留\n__construct\n，\nlock\n和\nunlock\n方法，使用上更加贴近\nphp flock\n。\n🐛\nBug 修复\n线程模式优化\n：\n修复\nSWOOLE_THREAD\n模式下\nhook_flags\n设置失效问题。\n修复因工作线程达到\nmax_request\n限制重启后，导致心跳线程持有失效指针并访问已释放内存的问题。\n修复不支持单独重启\nTask\n进程的问题。\n修复\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server\n在握手失败或连接关闭后，仍可能触发\nonMessage\n回调的问题。\n修复\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n因函数返回值类型与签名不一致导致的执行错误。\n修复\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n不支持启用 HTTP/2 的问题。\n修复\nSwoole\\Lock::lockwait()\n超时时间精度转换问题。\n修复因\nPHP 8\n兼容性调整及\nkeepalive\n连接清理不彻底，导致使用协程化\ncurl\n模块时出现\nReactorEpoll::add(): failed to add event\n警告的问题。\n修复\nSwoole\\Server::taskWaitMulti()\n在多线程模式下无法使用的问题。\n修复\nSwoole\\Server::taskCo()\n在多线程模式下资源竞争问题。\n稳定性提升\n：\n修复同步进程（含 manager 进程和 task 进程）无法正常使用\nprocess::signal()\n的问题。\n修正工作进程异常退出时的资源清理机制。\n解决 Cygwin 平台编译失败问题。\n修复curl开启keepalive无法复用socket的问题。\n改进日志组件以解决多线程模式下的数据一致性问题。\n修复\nio_uring\n的\nfutex\n特性在\nubuntu24.04\n编译失败的问题。\n修复结构体顺序赋值在低版本的linux系统会编译失败的问题。\n修复直接实例化的\nSwoole\\Process\n对象其\nid\n属性未初始化的问题。\n修复使用\nPIE\n编译swoole时，composer.json文件缺少\n--enable-zstd\n的选项的问题。\n修复了指定用户组后，\nworker\n进程因权限不足而无法向\nmanager\n进程发送信号的问题。\n兼容性改进\n：\n修复 PHP 8.5 下\nphp_swoole_register_shutdown_function\n兼容性问题。\n修正\nSwoole\\Table::get()\n对 null 参数的处理。\n协议处理\n：\n优化\nHTTP\n请求头与响应头中重复字段的处理机制，确保其正确合并。\n修复当系统没有\nzlib\n时，处理客户端\nAccept-Encoding: zlib\n请求头会触发未知压缩方法警告的问题。\n❌️\n废弃\n不再支持\nselect\n事件机制，\nselect\n仅支持\n1024\n个句柄的事件监听，存在严重缺陷，在不支持\nepoll/kqueue\n的平台将使用\npoll\n作为事件轮训机制，这使得\nCygwin\n平台下也可以支持大量并发。\n在\nSwoole\\Server::stop()\n方法中，第二个参数\n$waitEvent\n已被废弃，请使用\nreload_async\n参数。\n🛠️\n架构优化\n6.1\n版本增加了大量核心模块的单元测试，测试覆盖率提升至\n86%\n。通过系统性地补充测试用例并重构底层代码逻辑，同时结合\nclang-tidy\n工具链开展全量静态代码分析，实现了代码的自动化格式规整与冗余清理，使得代码可读性与可维护性得到显著提升。\n优化底层\nSSL\n模块。\n优化底层\nSocket\n模块。\n重构底层同步信号模块。\n重构底层\nreactor\n和\nstring\n模块。\n重构底层基于\nSIGRTMIN\n信号实现日志文件动态重载。\n优化底层静态文件服务器，移除C风格代码，统一为C++风格的代码。\n优化线程初始化逻辑，提高多线程性能，独立管理结构内存，线程创建和退出不需要再加锁。\n移除底层\nasync\n模块中的\nsocket_dontwait\n选项，该选项已废弃。\n完善\nWebSocket\n掩码处理的测试覆盖。\n优化\nsendfile\n功能，当文件小于\n64KB\n时不设置\ntcp_cork\n选项。\n增加\naarch64\n和\nmacOS\n环境下的单元测试。\n优化底层客户端网络地址解析和设置。\n为\nServer\n模块增加\nssl_cafile/ssl_capath\n配置项。\n增加\nprint_backtrace_on_error\n配置，此配置可以在发生位置错误时候，打印C函数的堆栈。\n增加\nAddress Sanitizer\n调试工具。\n增加\nCygwin\n测试，显著提升\nCygwin\n平台下的兼容性和稳定性\n在\nmacOS\n系统中，由于\nkqueue\n事件机制不支持跨进程管道事件监听，导致无法使用\nSWOOLE_PROCESS\n模式和\nTask\n进程功能。因此，系统将默认采用\npoll\n作为底层事件机制。如需启用\nkqueue\n，可以通过\nSwoole\\Server::set(['enable_kqueue' => true])\n和\nswoole_async_set(['enable_kqueue' => true])\n方法手动开启。\n升级\nSwoole library\n版本。\n禁用\n-Wdate-time\n警告，解决使用 Zig/Clang 编译时的错误。\n移除 PHP 8.0 相关兼容代码。\n在\nconfig.m4\n中新增\nSWOOLE_ODBC_LIBS\n变量。\n确保\ntimespec.tv_nsec\n取值小于\n1,000,000,000\n，以符合 POSIX 标准规范。\n重构\nswoole\n协程化\ncurl\n底层代码，提高与同步阻塞版本的兼容性。\n⚠️\n** 注意事项**\n自 Swoole 6.1 起，\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Client\n与\nSwoole\\Coroutine\\Http\\Server\n将自动处理 WebSocket 控制帧，除非显式设置\nopen_websocket_ping_frame\n、\nopen_websocket_pong_frame\n或\nopen_websocket_close_frame\n。\nSwoole\\Coroutine::cancel()\n无法取消文件协程化操作，取消文件操作可能导致段错误，因此在新版本中禁止了。\n若启用\n--enable-iouring\n，在检测到内核版本或\nliburing\n版本不满足要求时，将抛出警告信息。\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server::push\n方法在发送关闭帧后不会自动关闭连接，如需关闭连接，请使用\nSwoole\\Websocket\\Server::disconnect()\n方法。\nSwoole\n协议在处理控制帧时，会主动设置 FIN 标志位为 1，并确保不启用压缩（即 RSV1 位为 0），用户对此的设置将被忽略。\n当处理连续帧的压缩和发送时，\nSwoole\n将压缩与数据分块的职责移交至应用层，用户需手动实现相关逻辑。具体请看最下面的例子。\n系统默认启用了自动\nHTTP 100 Continue\n响应功能。\n在协程切换期间，将会保存并恢复\nserialize\n与\nunsealize\n操作相关的全局变量。\n💡\nAPI 变更\n新的锁 API\n函数原型\nnamespace\nSwoole\n\\\nCoroutine\n{\nclass\nLock

    "content": "See the\nupgrading guide\nfor detailed migration instructions. The changelog is relative to PHP-Parser 4.18.0.\nAdded\nAdded\nPhpVersion\nclass, which is accepted in a number of places (e.g. ParserFactory, Parser, Lexer, PrettyPrinter) and gives more precise control over the PHP version being targeted.\nAdded PHP 8 parser though it only differs from the PHP 7 parser in concatenation precedence.\nAdded\nParser::getTokens()\nmethod.\nAdded a\nModifiers\nclass, as a replacement for\nStmt\\Class_::MODIFIER_*\n.\nAdded support for returning an array or\nREMOVE_NODE\nfrom\nNodeVisitor::enterNode()\n.\nAdded many additional type annotations. PhpStan is now used.\nAdded a fuzzing target for PHP-Fuzzer, which was how a lot of pretty printer bugs were found.\nAdded\nisPromoted()\n,\nisPublic()\n,\nisProtected()\n,\nisPrivate()\nand\nisReadonly()\nmethods on\nParam\n.\nAdded support for class constants in trait builder.\nAdded\nPrettyPrinter\ninterface.\nAdded support for formatting preservation when toggling static modifiers.\nThe\nphp-parse\nbinary now accepts\n-\nas the file name, in which case it will read from stdin.\nAdded support for\nNodeVisitor::REPLACE_WITH_NULL\n.\nAdded support for CRLF newlines in the pretty printer, using the new\nnewline\noption.\nVisitors can now be passed directly to the\nNodeTraverser\nconstructor. A separate call to\naddVisitor()\nis no longer required.\nAdded support for printing additional attributes (like\nkind\n) in\nNodeDumper\n.\nAdded\nrawValue\nattribute to\nInterpolatedStringPart\nand heredoc/nowdoc\nString_\ns, which provides the original, unparsed value. It was previously only available for non-interpolated single/double quoted strings.\nAdded\nStmt\\Block\nto represent\n{}\ncode blocks. Previously, such code blocks were flattened into the parent statements array.\nStmt\\Block\nwill not be created for structures that are typically used with code blocks, for example\nif ($x) { $y; }\nwill be represented as previously, while\nif ($x) { { $x; } }\nwill have an extra\nStmt\\Block\nwrapper.\nChanged\nPHP 7.4 is now required to run PHP-Parser.\nProperty types have been added where possible.\nFormatting of the standard pretty printer has been adjusted to match PSR-12 more closely.\nThe internal token representation now uses a\nPhpParser\\Token\nclass, which is compatible with PHP 8 token representation (\nPhpToken\n).\nArray destructuring is now always represented using\nExpr\\List_\nnodes, even if it uses\n[]\nsyntax.\nRenamed a number of node classes, and moved things that were not real expressions/statements outside the\nExpr\n/\nStmt\nhierarchy. Compatibility shims for the old names have been retained.\nThe pretty printer no longer unconditionally wraps\nyield\nin parentheses, unless the target version is set to older than PHP 7.0.\nThe pretty printer now defaults to PHP 7.4 as the target version.\nPrint\nelse if { }\ninstead of\nelse { if { } }\n.\nThe\nleaveNode()\nmethod on visitors is now invoked in reverse order of\nenterNode()\n.\nMoved\nNodeTraverser::REMOVE_NODE\netc. to\nNodeVisitor::REMOVE_NODE\n. The old constants are still available for compatibility.\nThe\nName\nsubnode\nparts\nhas been replaced by\nname\n, which stores the name as a string rather than an array of parts separated by namespace separators. The\ngetParts()\nmethod returns the old representation.\nNo longer accept strings for types in Node constructors. Instead, either an\nIdentifier\n,\nName\nor\nComplexType\nmust be passed.\nComment::getReformattedText()\nnow normalizes CRLF newlines to LF newlines.\nThe\nLexer\nno longer accepts options.\nLexer\\Emulative\nonly accepts a\nPhpVersion\n. The\nstartLexing()\n,\ngetTokens()\nand\nhandleHaltCompiler()\nmethods have been removed. Instead, there is a single method\ntokenize()\nreturning the tokens.\nAttribute handling has been moved from the lexer to the parser, and is no longer configurable. The comments, startLine, endLine, startTokenPos, endTokenPos, startFilePos, and endFilePos attributes will always be added.\nThe pretty printer now indents heredoc/nowdoc strings if the target version is >= 7.3 (flexible heredoc/nowdoc).\nUse visitor to assign comments. This fixes the long-standing issue where comments were assigned to all nodes sharing a starting position. Now only the outer-most node will hold the comments.\nImprove NodeDumper performance for large dumps.\nRemoved\nThe PHP 5 parser has been removed. The PHP 7 parser has been adjusted to deal with PHP 5 code more gracefully.\nRemoved deprecated\nError\nconstructor taking a line number instead of an attributes array.\nThe deprecated\nComment::getLine()\n,\nComment::getTokenPos()\nand\nComment::getFilePos()\nmethods have been removed. Use\nComment::getStartLine()\n,\nComment::getStartTokenPos()\nand\nComment::getStartFilePos()\ninstead.\nRemoved\nStmt\\Throw_\nnode, use\nExpr\\Throw_\ninside\nStmt\\Expression\ninstead.\nRemoved\nParserFactory::create()\n.\nFixed\nThe pretty printer now uses a more accurate treatment of unary operator precedence, and will only wrap them in parentheses if required. This allowed fixing a number of other precedence related bugs.\nThe pretty printer now respects the precedence of\nclone\n,\nthrow\nand arrow functions.\nFixed formatting preservation for alternative elseif/else syntax.\nFixed checks for when it is safe to print strings as heredoc/nowdoc to accommodate flexible doc string semantics.\nFixed various cases where\n\\r\nat the end of a doc string could be incorrectly merged into a CRLF sequence with a following\n\\n\n.\n__halt_compiler\nis no longer recognized as a semi-reserved keyword, in line with PHP behavior.\n<?=\nis no longer recognized as a semi-reserved keyword.\nFix handling of very large overflowing\n\\u\nescape sequences.\nDon't trim leading whitespace in formatting preserving printer.\nTreat DEL as a label character in the formatting preserving printer depending on the targeted PHP version.\nFix error reporting in emulative lexer without explicitly specified error handler.\nGracefully handle non-contiguous array indices in the\nDiffer\n.\nDeprecated\nThe\nNode::getLine()\nmethod has been deprecated. Use\nNode::getStartLine()\ninstead.",
