    "content": "OpenSSL 3.2 Major changes between OpenSSL 3.1 and OpenSSL 3.2.0 [23 Nov 2023] OpenSSL 3.2.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to OpenSSL. This release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible changes: The default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2. The x509, ca, and req apps now always produce X.509v3 certificates. Subject or issuer names in X.509 objects are now displayed as UTF-8 strings by default. This release adds the following new features: Support for client side QUIC, including support for multiple streams (RFC 9000) Support for Ed25519ctx, Ed25519ph and Ed448ph in addition to existing support for Ed25519 and Ed448 (RFC 8032) Support for deterministic ECDSA signatures (RFC 6979) Support for AES-GCM-SIV, a nonce-misuse-resistant AEAD (RFC 8452) Support for the Argon2 KDF, along with supporting thread pool functionality (RFC 9106) Support for Hybrid Public Key Encryption (HPKE) (RFC 9180) Support for SM4-XTS Support for Brainpool curves in TLS 1.3 Support for TLS Raw Public Keys (RFC 7250) Support for TCP Fast Open on Linux, macOS and FreeBSD, where enabled and supported (RFC 7413) Support for TLS certificate compression, including library support for zlib, Brotli and zstd (RFC 8879) Support for provider-based pluggable signature algorithms in TLS 1.3 with supporting CMS and X.509 functionality With a suitable provider this enables the use of post-quantum/quantum-safe cryptography. Support for using the Windows system certificate store as a source of trusted root certificates This is not yet enabled by default and must be activated using an environment variable. This is likely to become enabled by default in a future feature release. Support for using the IANA standard names in TLS ciphersuite configuration Multiple new features and improvements to CMP protocol support The following known issues are present in this release and will be rectified in a future release: Provider-based signature algorithms cannot be configured using the SignatureAlgorithms configuration file parameter (#22761) This release incorporates the following documentation enhancements: Added multiple tutorials on the OpenSSL library and in particular on writing various clients (using TLS and QUIC protocols) with libssl See OpenSSL Guide. A more detailed list of changes in this release can be found in the CHANGES.md file. Users interested in using the new QUIC functionality are encouraged to read the README file for QUIC, which provides links to relevant documentation and example code. As always, bug reports and issues relating to OpenSSL can be filed on our issue tracker.",

    "content": "OpenSSL 3.3 Major changes between OpenSSL 3.2 and OpenSSL 3.3.0 [9 Apr 2024] OpenSSL 3.3.0 is a feature release adding significant new functionality to OpenSSL. This release adds the following new features: Support for qlog for tracing QUIC connections has been added Added APIs to allow configuring the negotiated idle timeout for QUIC connections, and to allow determining the number of additional streams that can currently be created for a QUIC connection. Added APIs to allow disabling implicit QUIC event processing for QUIC SSL objects Added APIs to allow querying the size and utilisation of a QUIC stream's write buffer New API SSL_write_ex2, which can be used to send an end-of-stream (FIN) condition in an optimised way when using QUIC. Limited support for polling of QUIC connection and stream objects in a non-blocking manner. Added a new EVP_DigestSqueeze() API. This allows SHAKE to squeeze multiple times with different output sizes. Added exporter for CMake on Unix and Windows, alongside the pkg-config exporter. The BLAKE2s hash algorithm matches BLAKE2b's support for configurable output length. The EVP_PKEY_fromdata function has been augmented to allow for the derivation of CRT (Chinese Remainder Theorem) parameters when requested Added API functions SSL_SESSION_get_time_ex(), SSL_SESSION_set_time_ex() using time_t which is Y2038 safe on 32 bit systems when 64 bit time is enabled Unknown entries in TLS SignatureAlgorithms, ClientSignatureAlgorithms config options and the respective calls to SSL[_CTX]_set1_sigalgs() and SSL[_CTX]_set1_client_sigalgs() that start with ? character are ignored and the configuration will still be used. Added -set_issuer and -set_subject options to openssl x509 to override the Issuer and Subject when creating a certificate. The -subj option now is an alias for -set_subject. Added several new features of CMPv3 defined in RFC 9480 and RFC 9483 New option SSL_OP_PREFER_NO_DHE_KEX, which allows configuring a TLS1.3 server to prefer session resumption using PSK-only key exchange over PSK with DHE, if both are available. New atexit configuration switch, which controls whether the OPENSSL_cleanup is registered when libcrypto is unloaded. Added X509_STORE_get1_objects to avoid issues with the existing X509_STORE_get0_objects API in multi-threaded applications. This release incorporates the following potentially significant or incompatible changes: Applied AES-GCM unroll8 optimisation to Microsoft Azure Cobalt 100 Optimized AES-CTR for ARM Neoverse V1 and V2 Enable AES and SHA3 optimisations on Applie Silicon M3-based MacOS systems similar to M1/M2. Various optimizations for cryptographic routines using RISC-V vector crypto extensions Added assembly implementation for md5 on loongarch64 Accept longer context for TLS 1.2 exporters The activate and soft_load configuration settings for providers in openssl.cnf have been updated to require a value of [1|yes|true|on] (in lower or UPPER case) to enable the setting. Conversely a value of [0|no|false|off] will disable the setting. In openssl speed, changed the default hash function used with hmac from md5 to sha256. The -verify option to the openssl crl and openssl req will make the program exit with 1 on failure. The d2i_ASN1_GENERALIZEDTIME(), d2i_ASN1_UTCTIME(), ASN1_TIME_check(), and related functions have been augmented to check for a minimum length of the input string, in accordance with ITU-T X.690 section 11.7 and 11.8. OPENSSL_sk_push() and sk__push() functions now return 0 instead of -1 if called with a NULL stack argument. New limit on HTTP response headers is introduced to HTTP client. The default limit is set to 256 header lines. This release incorporates the following bug fixes and mitigations: The BIO_get_new_index() function can only be called 127 times before it reaches its upper bound of BIO_TYPE_MASK and will now return -1 once its exhausted. A more detailed list of changes in this release can be found in the CHANGES.md file. Users interested in using the new QUIC functionality are encouraged to read the README file for QUIC, which provides links to relevant documentation and example code. As always, bug reports and issues relating to OpenSSL can be filed on our issue tracker.",

This caused an unreasonable slow-down in\njpeg_read_header()\nif an application called\njpeg_save_markers()\nto save markers of a particular type and then attempted to decompress a JPEG image containing an excessive number of markers of that type.\nHardened the default marker processor in the decompressor to guard against an issue (exposed by 3.0 beta2[6]) whereby attempting to decompress a specially-crafted malformed JPEG image (specifically an image with a complete 12-bit-per-sample Start Of Frame segment followed by an incomplete 8-bit-per-sample Start Of Frame segment) using buffered-image mode and input prefetching caused a segfault if the\nfill_input_buffer()\nmethod in the calling application's custom source manager incorrectly returned\nFALSE\nin response to a prematurely-terminated JPEG data stream.\nFixed an issue in cjpeg whereby, when generating a 12-bit-per-sample or 16-bit-per-sample lossless JPEG image, specifying a point transform value greater than 7 resulted in an error (\"Invalid progressive/lossless parameters\") unless the\n-precision\noption was specified before the\n-lossless\noption.\nFixed a regression introduced by 3.0.3[3] that made it impossible for calling applications to generate 12-bit-per-sample arithmetic-coded lossy JPEG images using the TurboJPEG API.\nFixed an error (\"Destination buffer is not large enough\") that occurred when attempting to generate a full-color lossless JPEG image using the TurboJPEG Java API's\nbyte[] TJCompressor.compress()\nmethod if the value of\nTJ.PARAM_SUBSAMP\nwas not\nTJ.SAMP_444\n.\nFixed a segfault in djpeg that occurred if a negative width was specified with the\n-crop\noption.  Since the cropping region width was read into an unsigned 32-bit integer, a negative width was interpreted as a very large value.  With certain negative width and positive left boundary values, the bounds checks in djpeg and\njpeg_crop_scanline()\noverflowed and did not detect the out-of-bounds width, which caused a buffer overrun in the upsampling or color conversion routine.  Both bounds checks now use 64-bit integers to guard against overflow, and djpeg now checks for negative numbers when it parses the crop specification from the command line.\nFixed an issue whereby the TurboJPEG lossless transformation function and methods checked the specified cropping region against the source image dimensions and level of chrominance subsampling rather than the destination image dimensions and level of chrominance subsampling, which caused some cropping regions to be unduly rejected when performing 90-degree rotation, 270-degree rotation, transposition, transverse transposition, or grayscale conversion.\nFixed a regression, introduced by 3.0 beta2[4], that prevented the\ntjTransform()\nbackward compatibility function from copying extra markers from the source image to the destination image.\nFixed an issue whereby the TurboJPEG lossless transformation function and methods did not honor\nTJXOPT_COPYNONE\n/\nTJTransform.OPT_COPYNONE\nunless it was specified for all lossless transforms.",

The underlying cause of these issues was that the color quantization and merged chroma upsampling/color conversion algorithms were not designed with lossless decompression in mind.  Since libjpeg-turbo explicitly does not support color conversion when compressing or decompressing lossless JPEG images, merged chroma upsampling/color conversion never should have been enabled for such images.  Color quantization is a legacy feature that serves little or no purpose with lossless JPEG images, so it is also now disabled when decompressing such images.  (As a result, djpeg can no longer decompress a lossless JPEG image into a GIF image.)\nFixed an oversight in 1.4 beta1[8] that caused various segfaults and buffer overruns when attempting to decompress various specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component JPEG images using djpeg with both color quantization and RGB565 color conversion enabled.\nFixed an issue whereby\njpeg_crop_scanline()\nsometimes miscalculated the downsampled width for components with 4x2 or 2x4 subsampling factors if decompression scaling was enabled.  This caused the components to be upsampled incompletely, which caused the color converter to read from uninitialized memory.  With 12-bit data precision, this caused a buffer overrun or underrun and subsequent segfault if the sample value read from uninitialized memory was outside of the valid sample range.\nFixed a long-standing issue whereby the\ntj3Transform()\nfunction, when used with the\nTJXOP_TRANSPOSE\n,\nTJXOP_TRANSVERSE\n,\nTJXOP_ROT90\n, or\nTJXOP_ROT270\ntransform operation and without automatic JPEG destination buffer (re)allocation or lossless cropping, computed the worst-case transformed JPEG image size based on the source image dimensions rather than the transformed image dimensions.  If a calling program allocated the JPEG destination buffer based on the transformed image dimensions, as the API documentation instructs, and attempted to transform a specially-crafted 4:2:2, 4:4:0, 4:1:1, or 4:4:1 JPEG source image containing a large amount of metadata, the issue caused\ntj3Transform()\nto overflow the JPEG destination buffer rather than fail gracefully.  The issue could be worked around by setting\nTJXOPT_COPYNONE\n.  Note that, irrespective of this issue,\ntj3Transform()\ncannot reliably transform JPEG source images that contain a large amount of metadata unless automatic JPEG destination buffer (re)allocation is used or\nTJXOPT_COPYNONE\nis set.\nFixed a regression introduced by 3.0 beta2[6] that prevented the djpeg\n-map\noption from working when decompressing 12-bit-per-component lossy JPEG images.\nFixed an issue that caused the C Huffman encoder (which is not used by default on x86 and Arm CPUs) to read from uninitialized memory when attempting to transform a specially-crafted malformed arithmetic-coded JPEG source image into a baseline Huffman-coded JPEG destination image.",

This improves code readability and facilitates adapting the libjpeg-turbo source code to non-CMake build systems.\nFixed an issue whereby decompressing a 4:2:0 or 4:2:2 JPEG image with merged upsampling disabled/one-pass color quantization enabled, then reusing the same API instance to decompress a 4:2:0 or 4:2:2 JPEG image with merged upsampling enabled/color quantization disabled, caused\njpeg_skip_scanlines()\nto use freed memory.  In practice, the freed memory was not reclaimed before it was used.  Thus, this issue did not cause a segfault or other user-visible errant behavior (it was only detectable with ASan), and it did not likely pose a security risk.\nThe AArch64 (Arm 64-bit) Neon SIMD extensions and accelerated Huffman codec now support the Arm64EC ABI on Windows, which allows Windows/x64 applications to call native Arm64 functions when running under the Windows/x64 emulator on Windows/Arm.",

Prominent features\n1.1. pidfd: pidfds for threads and pidfs\npifds (PID fd, a file descriptor that represents a process) is a concept that was added first in\nLinux 5.3\nto deal with the problems of traditional PIDs, and it has been gaining support in several APIs since then. In this release, pidfds add a few features:\nCreate pidfds for threads. Until now pidfds could only be created for thread-group leaders\nclone()\nand\nclone3()\ncan now be called with\nCLONE_PIDFD | CLONE_THREAD\nMoving pidfds to a tiny pseudo filesystem that allows several improvements\nRecommended LWN article:\nA new filesystem for pidfds\n1.2. x86 FRED support\nFRED (Fast Return and Event Delivery) is a new architecture on Intel processors that defines simple new transitions that change privilege level (ring transitions). It is a replacement for IDT event delivery on x86 and addresses most of the technical nightmares which IDT exposes.\nDocumentation\n1.3. BPF improvements: arenas and tokens\nThis new release incorporates, as usual, new BPF features. A couple of features stand out from the rest:\nBPF arenas: a sparse shared memory region between the BPF program and user space\nBPF tokens: provides the ability to delegate a subset of BPF subsystem functionality from privileged system-wide daemon (e.g., systemd or any other container manager) through special mount options for userns-bound BPF FS to a trusted unprivileged application. The main motivation is to enable containerized BPF applications to be used together with user namespaces. This is currently impossible, as CAP_BPF, required for BPF subsystem usage, cannot be namespaced or sandboxed, as a general rule.\nRecommended LWN articles:\nA proposal for shared memory in BPF programs\nFiner-grained BPF tokens\n1.4. Host support for AMD Secure Nested Paging\nAMD EPYC systems utilizing Zen 3 and newer microarchitectures add support for a new feature called SEV-SNP, which adds Secure Nested Paging support on top of the SEV/SEV-ES support already present on existing EPYC systems. This release adds support for acting as a KVM host capable of running SNP guests. One of the main features of SNP is the addition of an RMP (Reverse Map) table to enforce additional security protections for private guest memory.\n1.5. Weighted interleaving memory policies\nWhen trying to allocate memory, the kernel has to decide from which node NUMA node it should allocate that memory. The existing memory interleave mechanism does an even round-robin distribution of memory across all nodes. This release provides a weighted interleave mechanism that distributes memory across nodes according to a provided weight, which helps to provide greater use of the total available memory bandwidth.\nRecommended LWN article:\nWeighted interleaving for memory tiering\n1.6. Faster FUSE I/O\nThis release adds a passthrough mode for regular file I/O. This allows performing read and write (also via memory maps) on a backing file without incurring the overhead of roundtrips to userspace. For now this is only allowed to privileged servers, but this limitation will go away in the future.\nRecommended LWN article:\nFUSE passthrough for file I/O\n1.7. Slightly faster timer setup\nKernel code uses a lot of timers which are canceled or rearmed before they expire. However, when timers are enqueued a target CPU is choosen, which is wasted time if these timers are not going to be used. In this release, the CPU selection is avoided whenever possible, which makes some hot code paths in the kernel a bit faster in optional cases.\nRecommended LWN article:\nBetter CPU selection for timer expiration\n1.8. Device mapper VDO deduplication target\nThis release adds a new device mapper VDO (virtual data optimizer) target which provides block-level deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning. As a device mapper target, it can add these features to the storage stack, compatible with any file system. The vdo target does not protect against data corruption, relying instead on integrity protection of the storage below it.\nDocumentation:\ndm-vdo\nDocumentation:\nDesign of dm-vdo\n2.

    "content": "Linux 6.4\nwas released\non Sun, 25 Jun 2023.\n1. Prominent features\n1.1. Enable Intel's Linear Address Masking\nEnable Address Masking on Intel chips. This is similar to ARM's Top Byte Ignore and allows userspace to use some bits of pointers without masking it out before use, allowing sofware to use these untranslated address bits for metadata. The capability can be used for efficient address sanitizers (ASAN) implementation and for optimizations in JITs and virtual machines\nRecommended LWN article:\nSupport for Intel's Linear Address Masking\n1.2. Unprivileged Pressure Stall Information\nThis release allows for unprivileged\nPSI\npolling, which allow unprivileged tools to provide this information to users.\n1.3. New API for User-space trace events\nA new API has been added for user-space trace events. In this new model during the event registration from user programs 3 new values are specified. The first is the address to update when the event is either enabled or disabled. The second is the bit to set/clear to reflect the event being enabled. The third is the size of the value at the specified address\nRecommended LWN article:\nUser trace events, one year later\n.\n1.4. Safer Kernel Samepage Merging with a new process/cgroup API\nSo far KSM can only be enabled by calling\nmadvise()\nfor memory regions, but this API is too insecure. To be able to use KSM for more workloads, KSM needs to have the ability to be enabled and disabled at the process / cgroup level. This release adds two new options to the prctl system call. The first one allows to enable KSM at the process level and the second one to query the setting\nRecommended LWN article:\nProcess-level kernel samepage merging control\n1.5. More scalable memory management with per-VMA locks\nThe memory management subsystem has added a new kind of locks in each VMA (Virtual Memory Area, a data structure that representes virtual memory) which means that some operations will no longer use the\nmmap_lock\n. This improves scalability in a number of scenarios. For example, startup of Android apps with a large number of threads.\nRecommended LWN article:\nConcurrent page-fault handling with per-VMA locks\n1.6. More scalable context switching between user and kernel threads\nThis release improves scalability of context switching between user and kernel threads on large systems with a threaded process spread across a lot of CPUs\nThis takes lazy tlb mm shootdown IPI interrupts from 314 to 3 on a 144 POWERPC CPU system doing a kernel compile.\n1.7. New BPF features\nAs usual, this release brings new\nBPF open-coded iterators, support for kptrs in more BPF maps, kptr RCU, shared ownership for local kptrs, support 64-bit pointers to kfuncs, or first class support for attaching uprobes to functions inside ELF objects containers in Android APKs.\nRecommended LWN article:\nGeneric iterators for BPF\n1.8. Removal of the SELinux runtime disable capability\nFor security reasons, the ability to diable SELinux at runtime has been removed.\nRecommended LWN article:\nDisabling SELinux's runtime disable\n2.

Some applications use timeouts to wake someone waiting on completion entries, and this makes it a bit easier to just have a recurring timer rather than needing to rearm it every time\ncommit\nTake advantage of completion batching for uring commands\ncommit\ntask scheduler\nInterleave cfs bandwidth timers for improved single thread performance at low utilization\ncommit\nReduce cost of sched_move_task when config autogroup\ncommit\nFix performance regression introduced by mm_cid\ncommit\nprctl: Add PR_GET_AUXV to copy auxv to userspace\ncommit\nAdd Kthread flag to /proc/$pid/status\ncommit\npipes: support\nFMODE_NOWAIT\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nlocking\nlocking: Introduce local{,64}_try_cmpxchg\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nRemove diagnostics and adjust config for CSD lock diagnostics\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nrwbase: Mitigate indefinite writer starvation\ncommit\nRust\nAdd uapi crate\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: introduce\nLock\nand\nGuard\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nRust pin-init API for pinned initialization of structs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nalloc: vec: Add some missing fallible try_* methods\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: Arc: Any downcasting and assume_init()\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsync: Arc: Implement Debug and Display\ncommit\nerror: Add missing wrappers to convert to/from kernel error codes\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\ntools/nolibc\nAdding stdint.h, more integer types and tests\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nAdd support for stack protector\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nSupport vprintf() so we can use kselftest.h with nolibc\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nsplice: report related fsnotify events\ncommit\nswiotlb: Track and report io_tlb_used high water marks in debugfs\ncommit\nobjtool: Add stackleak instrumentation to uaccess safe list\ncommit\nAdd CONFIG_FW_DEVLINK_SYNC_STATE_TIMEOUT so that board specific kernels could enable it and not have to deal with setting or cluttering the kernel commandline\ncommit\nrtla/timerlat: Add auto-analysis only option\ncommit\nAdd vendor agnostic mechanism to report hardware sleep. A new file in suspend_stats is added where drivers can report into during their resume routine\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nGive more control of sync_state() in the form of a kernel commandline for a global timeout or a per device sysfs control to trigger sync_state()\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nptrace: Provide set/get interface for syscall user dispatch\ncommit\n3. File systems\n3.1. BTRFS\nImprove logging changes in a directory during one transaction, avoid iterating over items and reduce lock contention (fsync time 4x lower)\ncommit\nWhen logging directory entries during one transaction, reduce locking of subvolume trees by checking tree-log instead (improvement in throughput and latency for concurrent access to a subvolume)\ncommit\nscrub: rewrite scrub code flow, restructure how the stripes are enumerated and verified in a more unified way\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n3.2.

F2FS\nSupport iopoll method\ncommit\n3.6. NFS\nNFSD support for RPC-with-TLS (\nRFC 9289\n). The goal is to provide a simple-to-deploy, low-overhead in-transit confidentiality and peer authentication mechanism. It can supplement NFS Kerberos and it can protect the use of legacy non-cryptographic user authentication flavors such as AUTH_SYS. The TLS Record protocol is handled entirely by kTLS, meaning it can use either software encryption or offload encryption to smart NICs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nNFSv3: handle out-of-order write replies\ncommit\nConvert readdir to use folios\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nConvert the NFS fscache code to use netfs\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n3.7. 9P\nRemove writeback fid and fix per-file modes\ncommit\n,\ncommit\n,\ncommit\nAllow disable of xattr support on mount\ncommit\n4.

Mount notifications\nThis release includes an API to listen for mount topology changes without requiring looking at\n/proc/<pid>/mountinfo\n. A mount namespace file descriptor can be supplied and registered with\nfanotify()\nto listen for mount topology changes.\nCurrently notifications for mount, umount and moving mounts are generated. The generated notification record contains the unique mount id of the mount, which can then be used with\nlistmount()\nand\nstatmount()\n.\n1.2. Allow creating idmapped mounts from idmapped mounts\nIn previous releases it wasn't possible to allow the creation of idmapped mounts from already idmapped mounts. This release adds a new system call,\nopen_tree_attr()\nwhich works just like open_tree() but takes an optional struct mount_attr parameter.\n1.3. Support creating detached mounts from a detached mount\nCurrently, detached mounts can only be created from attached mounts. This limitaton prevents various use-cases. For example, the ability to mount a subdirectory without ever having to make the whole filesystem visible first. This release removes this limitation.\n1.4. Allow mount detached mounts on detached mounts\nCurrently, detached mounts can only be mounted onto attached mounts. This limitation makes it impossible to assemble a new private rootfs and move it into place. Instead, a detached tree must be created, attached, then mounted open and then either moved or detached again. This release lifts this restriction.\n1.5. Support detached mounts in overlayfs\nSince last cycle, overlayfs supports specifying layers via file descriptors. However, it does not allow detached mounts which means userspace cannot user file descriptors received via\nopen_tree(OPEN_TREE_CLONE)\nand\nfsmount()\ndirectly, they have to do dirty tricks. This release allows to directly use detached mounts.\n1.6. Support for broadcast TLB invalidation using AMD's INVLPGB instruction\nThis release adds support for the INVLPGB instruction on AMD systems that support it (Zen 3 and later). It allows the kernel to invalidate TLB entries on remote CPUs without needing to send IPIs, without having to wait for remote CPUs to handle those interrupts, and with less interruption to what was running on those CPUs. If you didn't understand any of these words, it means\nbetter overall performance\n.\n1.7. Support for latency profiling in perf\nThis release introduces latency profiling using scheduler information. The latency profiling is to show impacts on wall-time rather than cpu-time. By tracking context switches, it can weight samples and find which part of the code contributed more to the execution latency.\nAn example (after pasing\n--latency\nto perf record):\n$ perf report -s comm\n...\n#\n# Overhead   Latency  Command\n# ........  ........  ...............\n#\n78.97%    48.66%  cc1\n6.54%    25.68%  python3\n4.21%     0.39%  shellcheck\n3.28%    13.70%  ld\n[...]\nYou can see latency of cc1 is around 50% and python3 and ld contribute a lot more than their overhead.\n1.8. io_uring networking support for zero-copy receive\nThis release adds support for zero-copy receive with io_uring, enabling fast bulk receive of data directly into application memory, rather than needing to copy the data out of kernel memory. While this version only supports host memory as that was the initial target, other memory types are planned in the future as well.\nThis release also adds support for reading epoll events via io_uring. While this may seem counter-intuitive (and/or productive), the reasoning here is that quite a few existing epoll event loops can easily do a partial conversion to a completion based model, but are still stuck with one (or few) event types that remain readiness based.\n1.9. New fwctl subsystem to standarize firmware management\nfwctl is a new subsystem intended to bring some common rules and order to the growing pattern of exposing a secure FW interface directly to userspace. Unlike existing places like RDMA/DRM/VFIO/uacce that are exposing a device for datapath operations fwctl is focused on debugging, configuration and provisioning of the device.\nDocumentation:\nfwctl subsystem\n1.10. bcachefs improvements\nThis release adds some important features to the bcachefs filesystem, like scrubbing and support for blocksize greater than page size, and casefolding support.

Release 3.46.0 On 2024-05-23\nEnhance PRAGMA optimize in multiple ways, to make it\n     simpler to use:\n     \n PRAGMA optimize automatically implements a temporary\n          analysis limit to prevent excess runtime\n          on large databases.\n      Added the new 0x10000 bitmask option to check for updates on all tables.\n      Automatically re-analyze tables that do not have sqlite_stat1 entries.\n     \n Enhancements to the date and time functions:\n     \n The strftime() SQL function now supports %G, %g, %U, and %V.\n      New modifiers 'ceiling' and 'floor' control the algorithm used to\n          resolve ambiguous dates when shifting a date by an integer number\n          of months and/or years.\n      The 'utc' and 'localtime' modifiers are now no-ops if SQLite knows\n          that the time is already in UTC or in the localtime, respectively.\n     \n Add support for underscore (\"_\") characters between digits in\n     numeric literals.\n Add the json_pretty() SQL function.\n Query planner improvements:\n     \n The \"VALUES-as-coroutine\" optimization enables INSERT statements with \n          thousands of rows in the VALUES clause to parse and run in about half\n          the time and using about half as much memory.\n      Allow the use of an index for queries like \"SELECT count(DISTINCT col) FROM ...\",\n          even if the index records are not smaller than the table records.\n      Improved recognition of cases where the value of an SQL function is\n          constant because all its arguments are constant.\n      Enhance the WHERE-clause push-down optimization so that it is able to\n          push down WHERE clause terms containing uncorrelated subqueries.\n     \n Allocate additional memory from the heap for the SQL parser stack if\n     that stack overflows, rather than reporting a \"parser stack overflow\" error.\n JSON changes:\n     \n Allow ASCII control characters within JSON5 string literals.\n      Fix the -> and ->> operators so that when the right-hand side operand is a string\n          that looks like an integer it is still treated as a string, because that is what\n          PostgreSQL does.\n     \n Allow large hexadecimal literals to be used as the DEFAULT value to a table column.\nHashes:\nSQLITE_SOURCE_ID: 2024-05-23 13:25:27

(CVE-2025-4207)\nHandle self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables correctly (Álvaro Herrera) §\nCreating or attaching partitions failed to make the required catalog entries for a foreign-key constraint, if the table referenced by the constraint was the same partitioned table. This resulted in failure to enforce the constraint fully.\nTo fix this, you should drop and recreate any self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables, if partitions have been created or attached since the constraint was created. Bear in mind that violating rows might already be present, in which case recreating the constraint will fail, and you'll need to fix up those rows before trying again.\nHandle self-referential foreign keys on partitioned tables correctly (Álvaro Herrera) §\nCreating or attaching partitions failed to make the required catalog entries for a foreign-key constraint, if the table referenced by the constraint was the same partitioned table.

But this is problematic if the aggregate inputs include expressions that could fail (for example, a division where some of the input divisors could be zero) and there is a FILTER clause that's meant to prevent such failures. Pre-sorting would push the expression evaluations to before the FILTER test, allowing the failures to happen anyway. Avoid this by not pre-sorting if there's a FILTER and the input expressions are anything more complex than a simple Var or Const.\nAvoid premature evaluation of the arguments of an aggregate function that has both FILTER and ORDER BY (or DISTINCT) options (David Rowley) §\nFILTER\nORDER BY\nDISTINCT\nIf there is ORDER BY or DISTINCT, we consider pre-sorting the aggregate input values rather than doing the sort within the Agg plan node.

For information about new features in major release 16, see Section E.12.\nE.9.1. Migration to Version 16.3 #\nA dump/restore is not required for those running 16.X.\nHowever, a security vulnerability was found in the system views pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs, potentially allowing authenticated database users to see data they shouldn't. If this is of concern in your installation, follow the steps in the first changelog entry below to rectify it.\npg_stats_ext\npg_stats_ext_exprs\nAlso, if you are upgrading from a version earlier than 16.2, see Section E.10.\nE.9.2. Changes #\nRestrict visibility of pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs entries to the table owner (Nathan Bossart) §\nThese views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve columns the accessing user does not have permission to read. View columns such as most_common_vals might expose security-relevant data. The potential interactions here are not fully clear, so in the interest of erring on the side of safety, make rows in these views visible only to the owner of the associated table.\nThe PostgreSQL Project thanks Lukas Fittl for reporting this problem. (CVE-2024-4317)\nBy itself, this fix will only fix the behavior in newly initdb'd database clusters. If you wish to apply this change in an existing cluster, you will need to do the following:\n\n\n\nFind the SQL script fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql in the share directory of the PostgreSQL installation (typically located someplace like /usr/share/postgresql/). Be sure to use the script appropriate to your PostgreSQL major version. If you do not see this file, either your version is not vulnerable (only v14–v16 are affected) or your minor version is too old to have the fix.\n\n\nIn each database of the cluster, run the fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql script as superuser. In psql this would look like\n\n\\i /usr/share/postgresql/fix-CVE-2024-4317.sql\n\n(adjust the file path as appropriate). Any error probably indicates that you've used the wrong script version. It will not hurt to run the script more than once.\n\n\nDo not forget to include the template0 and template1 databases, or the vulnerability will still exist in databases you create later. To fix template0, you'll need to temporarily make it accept connections. Do that with\n\nALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS true;\n\nand then after fixing template0, undo it with\n\nALTER DATABASE template0 WITH ALLOW_CONNECTIONS false;\nRestrict visibility of pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs entries to the table owner (Nathan Bossart) §\npg_stats_ext\npg_stats_ext_exprs\nThese views failed to hide statistics for expressions that involve columns the accessing user does not have permission to read.

    "content": "Description\nThis release of Mbed TLS provides bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.\nMbed TLS 3.6 is a long-term support (LTS) branch. It will be supported with bug-fixes and security fixes until at least March 2027.\nSecurity Advisories\nFor full details, please see the following links:\nCTR_DRBG\nprioritized over\nHMAC_DRBG\nas the PSA DRBG\nStack buffer overflow in ECDSA signature conversion functions\nLimited authentication bypass in TLS 1.3 optional client authentication\n❕\nRelease notes are truncated in GitHub's releases page\n: Please refer to the\n3.6.1\nrelease page.\nRelease Notes\nAPI changes\nThe experimental functions psa_generate_key_ext() and\npsa_key_derivation_output_key_ext() are no longer declared when compiling\nin C++. This resolves a build failure under C++ compilers that do not\nsupport flexible array members (a C99 feature not adopted by C++).\nFixes\n#9020\n.\nDefault behavior changes\nIn a PSA-client-only build (i.e. MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CLIENT &&\n!MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C), do not automatically enable local crypto when the\ncorresponding PSA mechanism is enabled, since the server provides the\ncrypto. Fixes\n#9126\n.\nA TLS handshake may now call psa_crypto_init() if TLS 1.3 is enabled.\nThis can happen even if TLS 1.3 is offered but eventually not selected\nin the protocol version negotiation.\nBy default, the handling of TLS 1.3 tickets by the Mbed TLS client is now\ndisabled at runtime. Applications that were using TLS 1.3 tickets\nsignalled by MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_RECEIVED_NEW_SESSION_TICKET return values now\nneed to enable the handling of TLS 1.3 tickets through the new\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_tls13_enable_signal_new_session_tickets() API.\nNew deprecations\nThe experimental functions psa_generate_key_ext() and\npsa_key_derivation_output_key_ext() are deprecated in favor of\npsa_generate_key_custom() and psa_key_derivation_output_key_custom().\nThey have almost exactly the same interface, but the variable-length\ndata is passed in a separate parameter instead of a flexible array\nmember.\nThe following cryptographic mechanisms are planned to be removed\nin Mbed TLS 4.0:\nDES (including 3DES).\nPKCS#1v1.5 encryption/decryption (RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5).\n(OAEP, PSS, and PKCS#1v1.5 signature are staying.)\nFinite-field Diffie-Hellman with custom groups.\n(RFC 7919 groups remain supported.)\nElliptic curves of size 225 bits or less.\nThe following cipher suites are planned to be removed from (D)TLS 1.2\nin Mbed TLS 4.0:\nTLS_RSA_* (including TLS_RSA_PSK_\n), i.e. cipher suites using\nRSA decryption.\n(RSA signatures, i.e. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_\n, are staying.)\nTLS_ECDH_\n, i.e. cipher suites using static ECDH.\n(Ephemeral ECDH, i.e. TLS_ECDHE_\n, is staying.)\nTLS_DHE_\n, i.e. cipher suites using finite-field Diffie-Hellman.\n(Ephemeral ECDH, i.e. TLS_ECDHE_\n, is staying.)\nTLS_\nCBC\n, i.e. all cipher suites using CBC.\nThe following low-level application interfaces are planned to be removed\nfrom the public API in Mbed TLS 4.0:\nHashes: hkdf.h, md5.h, ripemd160.h, sha1.h, sha3.h, sha256.h, sha512.h;\nRandom generation: ctr_drbg.h, hmac_drbg.h, entropy.h;\nCiphers and modes: aes.h, aria.h, camellia.h, chacha20.h, chachapoly.h,\ncipher.h, cmac.h, gcm.h, poly1305.h;\nPrivate key encryption mechanisms: pkcs5.h, pkcs12.h.\nAsymmetric cryptography: bignum.h, dhm.h, ecdh.h, ecdsa.h, ecjpake.h,\necp.h, rsa.h.\nThe cryptographic mechanisms remain present, but they will only be\naccessible via the PSA API (psa_xxx functions introduced gradually\nstarting with Mbed TLS 2.17) and, where relevant,\npk.h\n.\nFor guidance on migrating application code to the PSA API, please consult\nthe PSA transition guide (docs/psa-transition.md).\nThe following integration interfaces are planned to be removed\nin Mbed TLS 4.0:\nMBEDTLS_xxx_ALT replacement of cryptographic modules and functions.\nUse PSA transparent drivers instead.\nMBEDTLS_PK_RSA_ALT and MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_SE_C.\nUse PSA opaque drivers instead.\nFeatures\nWhen the new compilation option MBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_STORE_DYNAMIC is enabled,\nthe number of volatile PSA keys is virtually unlimited, at the expense\nof increased code size. This option is off by default, but enabled in\nthe default mbedtls_config.h. Fixes\n#9216\n.\nSecurity\nUnlike previously documented, enabling MBEDTLS_PSA_HMAC_DRBG_MD_TYPE does\nnot cause the PSA subsystem to use HMAC_DRBG: it uses HMAC_DRBG only when\nMBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_EXTERNAL_RNG and MBEDTLS_CTR_DRBG_C are disabled.\nCVE-2024-45157\nFix a stack buffer overflow in mbedtls_ecdsa_der_to_raw() and\nmbedtls_ecdsa_raw_to_der() when the bits parameter is larger than the\nlargest supported curve. In some configurations with PSA disabled,\nall values of bits are affected. This never happens in internal library\ncalls, but can affect applications that call these functions directly.\nCVE-2024-45158\nWith TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the\nclient, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values\nin keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of\nmbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the\nMBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_EXT_KEY_USAGE bits\nclear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other\nthan TLS client authentication could be able to use it for TLS client\nauthentication anyway. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with\noptional authentication (required would abort the handshake with a fatal\nalert).\nCVE-2024-45159\nBugfix\nFix TLS 1.3 client build and runtime when support for session tickets is\ndisabled (MBEDTLS_SSL_SESSION_TICKETS configuration option). Fixes\n#6395\n.\nFix compilation error when memcpy() is a function-like macros. Fixes\n#8994\n.\nMBEDTLS_ASN1_PARSE_C and MBEDTLS_ASN1_WRITE_C are now automatically enabled\nas soon as MBEDTLS_RSA_C is enabled. Fixes\n#9041\n.\nFix undefined behaviour (incrementing a NULL pointer by zero length) when\npassing in zero length additional data to multipart AEAD.\nFix rare concurrent access bug where attempting to operate on a\nnon-existent key while concurrently creating a new key could potentially\ncorrupt the key store.\nFix error handling when creating a key in a dynamic secure element\n(feature enabled by MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_SE_C). In a low memory condition,\nthe creation could return PSA_SUCCESS but using or destroying the key\nwould not work. Fixes\n#8537\n.\nFix issue of redefinition warning messages for _GNU_SOURCE in\nentropy_poll.c and sha_256.c. There was a build warning during\nbuilding for linux platform.\nResolves\n#9026\nFix a compilation warning in pk.c when PSA is enabled and RSA is disabled.\nFix the build when MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_CONFIG is enabled and the built-in\nCMAC is enabled, but no built-in unauthenticated cipher is enabled.\nFixes\n#9209\n.\nFix redefinition warnings when SECP192R1 and/or SECP192K1 are disabled.\nFixes\n#9029\n.\nFix psa_cipher_decrypt() with CCM* rejecting messages less than 3 bytes\nlong. Credit to Cryptofuzz. Fixes\n#9314\n.\nFix interference between PSA volatile keys and built-in keys\nwhen MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_BUILTIN_KEYS is enabled and\nMBEDTLS_PSA_KEY_SLOT_COUNT is more than 4096.\nDocument and enforce the limitation of mbedtls_psa_register_se_key()\nto persistent keys. Resolves\n#9253\n.\nFix Clang compilation error when MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled\nbut MBEDTLS_DHM_C is disabled. Reported by Michael Schuster in\n#9188\n.\nFix server mode only build when MBEDTLS_SSL_SRV_C is enabled but\nMBEDTLS_SSL_CLI_C is disabled. Reported by M-Bab on GitHub in\n#9186\n.\nWhen MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_C was disabled and MBEDTLS_ECDSA_C enabled,\nsome code was defining 0-size arrays, resulting in compilation errors.\nFixed by disabling the offending code in configurations without PSA\nCrypto, where it never worked. Fixes\n#9311\n.\nFix unintended performance regression when using short RSA public keys.\nFixes\n#9232\n.\nFixes an issue where some TLS 1.2 clients could not connect to an\nMbed TLS 3.6.0 server, due to incorrect handling of\nlegacy_compression_methods in the ClientHello.\nFixes\n#8995\n,\n#9243\n.\nFix TLS connections failing when the handshake selects TLS 1.3\nin an application that does not call psa_crypto_init().\nFixes\n#9072\n.\nFix TLS connection failure in applications using an Mbed TLS client in\nthe default configuration connecting to a TLS 1.3 server sending tickets.\nSee the documentation of\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_tls13_enable_signal_new_session_tickets() for more\ninformation.\nFixes\n#8749\n.\nFix a memory leak that could occur when failing to process an RSA\nkey through some PSA functions due to low memory conditions.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where the CA callback set with\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_cb() would stop working when connections were\nupgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding support for the CA callback with TLS\n1.3.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where clients that relied on\noptional/none authentication mode, by calling mbedtls_ssl_conf_authmode()\nwith MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL or MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_NONE, would stop\nworking when connections were upgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding\nsupport for optional/none with TLS 1.3 as well. Note that the TLS 1.3\nstandard makes server authentication mandatory; users are advised not to\nuse authmode none, and to carefully check the results when using optional\nmode.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where context-specific certificate\nverify callbacks, set with mbedtls_ssl_set_verify() as opposed to\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_verify(), would stop working when connections were\nupgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding support for context-specific verify\ncallback in TLS 1.3.\nChanges\nWarn if mbedtls/check_config.h is included manually, as this can\nlead to spurious errors. Error if a\nadjust\n.h header is included\nmanually, as this can lead to silently inconsistent configurations,\npotentially resulting in buffer overflows.\nWhen migrating from Mbed TLS 2.x, if you had a custom config.h that\nincluded check_config.h, remove this inclusion from the Mbed TLS 3.x\nconfiguration file (renamed to mbedtls_config.h). This change was made\nin Mbed TLS 3.0, but was not announced in a changelog entry at the time.\nWho should update\nWe recommend all users should update to take advantage of the bug fixes contained in this release at an appropriate point in their development lifecycle.\nNote\n❕\nmbedtls-3.6.1.tar.bz2\nare our official release files.\nsource.tar.gz\nand\nsource.zip\nare automatically generated snapshot's that github is generating.

    "content": "Description\nThe Mbed TLS 4.0.0 and TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0 releases introduce a major codebase restructuring:\nPSA Crypto functionality now resides in its own repository Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto.\nTLS and X.509 components remain in Mbed TLS.\nAPI Changes & Migration\nThe Mbed TLS 4.0.0 and TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0 releases include significant API changes that break backward compatibility with previous releases. Please test your integration thoroughly and follow the\n4.0 migration guide\nand TF-PSA-Crypto's\n1.0 migration guide\nto update your codebase to the new interfaces.\nPlease note\nMbed TLS 4.0.0 includes TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0 (as a subtree in the tarball, and as a submodule in git) and can only be built with this included version TF-PSA-Crypto.\nSecurity Advisories\nCompared to Mbed TLS 3.6.4 (the latest LTS release that pre-dates it), Mbed TLS 4.0.0 does not directly fix any new vulnerability. However two vulnerabilities are fixed in TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0, which is included in Mbed TLS 4.0.0. See the release notes of TF-PSA-Crypto 1.0.0 for details about those two fixes.\nCompared to Mbed TLS 3.6.0 (the latest feature release that pre-dates it), Mbed TLS 4.0.0 also fixes the following vulnerabilities, that had been fixed in Mbed TLS 3.6.4 already:\nCTR_DRBG\nprioritized over\nHMAC_DRBG\nas the PSA DRBG\nStack buffer overflow in ECDSA signature conversion functions\nLimited authentication bypass in TLS 1.3 optional client authentication\nBuffer underrun in pkwrite when writing an opaque key pair\nTLS clients should generally call mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname\nPotential authentication bypass in TLS handshake\nMisleading memory management in\nmbedtls_x509_string_to_names()\nNULL pointer dereference after using\nmbedtls_asn1_store_named_data()\nRelease Notes\nAPI changes\nAlign the mbedtls_ssl_ticket_setup() function with the PSA Crypto API.\nInstead of taking a mbedtls_cipher_type_t as an argument, this function\nnow takes 3 new arguments: a PSA algorithm, key type and key size, to\nspecify the AEAD for ticket protection.\nThe PSA and Mbed TLS error spaces are now unified. mbedtls_xxx()\nfunctions can now return PSA_ERROR_xxx values.\nThere is no longer a distinction between \"low-level\" and \"high-level\"\nMbed TLS error codes.\nThis will not affect most applications since the error values are\nbetween -32767 and -1 as before.\nAll API functions now use the PSA random generator psa_generate_random()\ninternally. As a consequence, functions no longer take RNG parameters.\nPlease refer to the migration guide at :\ndocs/4.0-migration-guide.md.\nThe list passed to mbedtls_ssl_conf_alpn_protocols() is now declared\nas having const elements, reflecting the fact that the library will\nnot modify it\nChange the serial argument of the mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial_raw\nfunction to a const to align with the rest of the API.\nChange the signature of the runtime version information methods that took\na char* as an argument to take zero arguments and return a const char*\ninstead. This aligns us with the interface used in TF PSA Crypto 1.0.\nIf you need to support linking against both Mbed TLS 3.x and 4.x, please\nuse the build-time version macros or mbedtls_version_get_number() to\ndetermine the correct signature for mbedtls_version_get_string() and\nmbedtls_version_get_string_full() before calling them.\nFixes issue\n#10308\n.\nMake the following error codes aliases of their PSA equivalents, where\nxxx is a module, e.g. X509 or SSL.\nMBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BAD_INPUT_DATA    -> PSA_ERROR_INVALID_ARGUMENT\nMBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_ALLOC_FAILED      -> PSA_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY\nMBEDTLS_ERR_xxx_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  -> PSA_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL\nMBEDTLS_ERR_PKCS7_VERIFY_FAIL     -> PSA_ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE\nAdd MBEDTLS_SSL_NULL_CIPHERSUITES configuration option. It enables\nTLS 1.2 ciphersuites without encryption and is disabled by default.\nThis new option replaces MBEDTLS_CIPHER_NULL_CIPHER.\nDefault behavior changes\nThe X.509 and TLS modules now always use the PSA subsystem\nto perform cryptographic operations, with a few exceptions documented\nin docs/architecture/psa-migration/psa-limitations.md. This\ncorresponds to the behavior of Mbed TLS 3.x when\nMBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO is enabled. In effect, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO\nis now always enabled.\npsa_crypto_init() must be called before performing any cryptographic\noperation, including indirect requests such as parsing a key or\ncertificate or starting a TLS handshake.\nIn TLS clients, if mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname() has not been called,\nmbedtls_ssl_handshake() now fails with\nMBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_WITHOUT_HOSTNAME\nif certificate-based authentication of the server is attempted.\nThis is because authenticating a server without knowing what name\nto expect is usually insecure.\nRemovals\nRemove support for the RSA-PSK key exchange in TLS 1.2.\nRemove deprecated mbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial(). The function was\nalready deprecated and superseded by\nmbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial_raw().\nRemove the function mbedtls_ssl_conf_curves() which had been deprecated\nin favour of mbedtls_ssl_conf_groups() since Mbed TLS 3.1.\nRemove support for the DHE-PSK key exchange in TLS 1.2.\nRemove support for the DHE-RSA key exchange in TLS 1.2.\nFollowing the removal of DHM module (\n#9972\nand TF-PSA-Crypto#175) the\nfollowing SSL functions are removed:\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_bin\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_dh_param_ctx\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_dhm_min_bitlen\nRemove support for the RSA key exchange in TLS 1.2.\nRemove mbedtls_low_level_strerr() and mbedtls_high_level_strerr(),\nsince these concepts no longer exists. There is just mbedtls_strerror().\nSample programs for the legacy crypto API have been removed.\npkey/rsa_genkey.c\npkey/pk_decrypt.c\npkey/dh_genprime.c\npkey/rsa_verify.c\npkey/mpi_demo.c\npkey/rsa_decrypt.c\npkey/key_app.c\npkey/dh_server.c\npkey/ecdh_curve25519.c\npkey/pk_encrypt.c\npkey/rsa_sign.c\npkey/key_app_writer.c\npkey/dh_client.c\npkey/ecdsa.c\npkey/rsa_encrypt.c\nwince_main.c\naes/crypt_and_hash.c\nrandom/gen_random_ctr_drbg.c\nrandom/gen_entropy.c\nhash/md_hmac_demo.c\nhash/hello.c\nhash/generic_sum.c\ncipher/cipher_aead_demo.c\nRemove compat-2-x.h header from mbedtls.\nThe library no longer offers interfaces to look up values by OID\nor OID by enum values.\nThe header <mbedtls/oid.h> now only defines functions to convert\nbetween binary and dotted string OID representations, and macros\nfor OID strings that are relevant to X.509.\nThe compilation option MBEDTLS_OID_C no longer\nexists. OID tables are included in the build automatically as needed.\nThe header <mbedtls/check_config.h> no longer exists. Including it\nfrom a custom config file was no longer needed since Mbed TLS 3.0,\nand could lead to spurious errors. The checks that it performed are\nnow done automatically when building the library.\nSupport for secp192k1, secp192r1, secp224k1 and secp224r1 EC curves is\nremoved from TLS.\nRemove mbedtls_pk_type_t from the public interface and replace it with\nmbedtls_pk_sigalg_t.\nRemove MBEDTLS_SSL_DTLS_CONNECTION_ID_COMPAT. Now only the\nstandard version (defined in RFC 9146) of DTLS connection ID is supported.\nRemove mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_version(), mbedtls_ssl_conf_max_version(), and\nthe associated constants MBEDTLS_SSL_MAJOR_VERSION_x and\nMBEDTLS_SSL_MINOR_VERSION_y. Use mbedtls_ssl_conf_min_tls_version() and\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_max_tls_version() with MBEDTLS_SSL_VERSION_TLS1_y instead.\nNote that the new names of the new constants use the TLS protocol versions,\nunlike the old constants whose names are based on internal encodings.\nRemove mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_hashes(). Use mbedtls_ssl_conf_sig_algs()\ninstead.\nRemoved all public key sample programs from the programs/pkey\ndirectory.\nRemoved support for TLS 1.2 static ECDH key\nexchanges (ECDH-ECDSA and ECDH-RSA).\nDrop support for the GNU Make and Microsoft Visual Studio build systems.\nFeatures\nAdd the function mbedtls_ssl_export_keying_material() which allows the\nclient and server to extract additional shared symmetric keys from an SSL\nsession, according to the TLS-Exporter specification in RFC 8446 and 5705.\nThis requires MBEDTLS_SSL_KEYING_MATERIAL_EXPORT to be defined in\nmbedtls_config.h.\nSecurity\nWith TLS 1.3, when a server enables optional authentication of the\nclient, if the client-provided certificate does not have appropriate values\nin keyUsage or extKeyUsage extensions, then the return value of\nmbedtls_ssl_get_verify_result() would incorrectly have the\nMBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_KEY_USAGE and MBEDTLS_X509_BADCERT_EXT_KEY_USAGE bits\nclear. As a result, an attacker that had a certificate valid for uses other\nthan TLS client authentication could be able to use it for TLS client\nauthentication anyway. Only TLS 1.3 servers were affected, and only with\noptional authentication (required would abort the handshake with a fatal\nalert).\nCVE-2024-45159\nNote that TLS clients should generally call mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname()\nif they use certificate authentication (i.e. not pre-shared keys).\nOtherwise, in many scenarios, the server could be impersonated.\nThe library will now prevent the handshake and return\nMBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_WITHOUT_HOSTNAME\nif mbedtls_ssl_set_hostname() has not been called.\nReported by Daniel Stenberg.\nCVE-2025-27809\nFix a vulnerability in the TLS 1.2 handshake. If memory allocation failed\nor there was a cryptographic hardware failure when calculating the\nFinished message, it could be calculated incorrectly. This would break\nthe security guarantees of the TLS handshake.\nCVE-2025-27810\nFix possible use-after-free or double-free in code calling\nmbedtls_x509_string_to_names(). This was caused by the function calling\nmbedtls_asn1_free_named_data_list() on its head argument, while the\ndocumentation did no suggest it did, making it likely for callers relying\non the documented behaviour to still hold pointers to memory blocks after\nthey were free()d, resulting in high risk of use-after-free or double-free,\nwith consequences ranging up to arbitrary code execution.\nIn particular, the two sample programs x509/cert_write and x509/cert_req\nwere affected (use-after-free if the san string contains more than one DN).\nCode that does not call mbedtls_string_to_names() directly is not affected.\nFound by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.\nCVE-2025-47917\nFix a bug in mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() and the\nmbedtls_x509write_{crt,csr}\nset\n{subject,issuer}_name() functions,\nwhere some inputs would cause an inconsistent state to be reached, causing\na NULL dereference either in the function itself, or in subsequent\nusers of the output structure, such as mbedtls_x509_write_names(). This\nonly affects applications that create (as opposed to consume) X.509\ncertificates, CSRs or CRLs. Found by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.\nCVE-2025-48965\nFix a bug in tf-psa-crypto's mbedtls_asn1_store_named_data() where it\nwould sometimes leave an item in the output list in an inconsistent\nstate with val.p == NULL but val.len > 0. Affected functions used in X.509\nwould then dereference a NULL pointer. Applications that do not\ncall this function (directly, or indirectly through X.509 writing) are not\naffected. Found by Linh Le and Ngan Nguyen from Calif.\nCVE-2025-48965\nBugfix\nFix TLS 1.3 client build and runtime when support for session tickets is\ndisabled (MBEDTLS_SSL_SESSION_TICKETS configuration option). Fixes\n#6395\n.\nFix compilation error when memcpy() is a function-like macros. Fixes\n#8994\n.\nFix Clang compilation error when finite-field Diffie-Hellman is disabled.\nReported by Michael Schuster in\n#9188\n.\nFix server mode only build when MBEDTLS_SSL_SRV_C is enabled but\nMBEDTLS_SSL_CLI_C is disabled. Reported by M-Bab on GitHub in\n#9186\n.\nFixes an issue where some TLS 1.2 clients could not connect to an\nMbed TLS 3.6.0 server, due to incorrect handling of\nlegacy_compression_methods in the ClientHello.\nfixes\n#8995\n,\n#9243\n.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where the CA callback set with\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_ca_cb() would stop working when connections were\nupgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding support for the CA callback with TLS\n1.3.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where clients that relied on\noptional/none authentication mode, by calling mbedtls_ssl_conf_authmode()\nwith MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_OPTIONAL or MBEDTLS_SSL_VERIFY_NONE, would stop\nworking when connections were upgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding\nsupport for optional/none with TLS 1.3 as well. Note that the TLS 1.3\nstandard makes server authentication mandatory; users are advised not to\nuse authmode none, and to carefully check the results when using optional\nmode.\nFixed a regression introduced in 3.6.0 where context-specific certificate\nverify callbacks, set with mbedtls_ssl_set_verify() as opposed to\nmbedtls_ssl_conf_verify(), would stop working when connections were\nupgraded to TLS 1.3. Fixed by adding support for context-specific verify\ncallback in TLS 1.3.\nWhen MBEDTLS_SSL_TLS1_3_COMPATIBILITY_MODE is disabled, work with\npeers that have middlebox compatibility enabled, as long as no\nproblematic middlebox is in the way. Fixes\n#9551\n.\nUse 'mbedtls_net_close' instead of 'close' in 'mbedtls_net_bind'\nand 'mbedtls_net_connect' to prevent possible double close fd\nproblems. Fixes\n#9711\n.\nFix compilation on MS-DOS DJGPP. Fixes\n#9813\n.\nSupport re-assembly of fragmented handshake messages in TLS (both\n1.2 and 1.3). The lack of support was causing handshake failures with\nsome servers, especially with TLS 1.3 in practice. There are a few\nlimitations, notably a fragmented ClientHello is only supported when\nTLS 1.3 support is enabled. See the documentation of\nmbedtls_ssl_handshake() for details.\nFix definition of MBEDTLS_PRINTF_SIZET to prevent runtime crashes that\noccurred whenever SSL debugging was enabled on a copy of Mbed TLS built\nwith Visual Studio 2013 or MinGW.\nFixes\n#10017\n.\nSilence spurious -Wunterminated-string-initialization warnings introduced\nby GCC 15. Fixes\n#9944\n.\nFix potential CMake parallel build failure when building both the static\nand shared libraries.\nFix a build error or incorrect TLS session\nlifetime on platforms where mbedtls_time_t\nis not time_t. Fixes\n#10236\n.\nChanges\nFunctions regarding numeric string conversions for OIDs have been moved\nfrom the OID module and now reside in X.509 module. This helps to reduce\nthe code size as these functions are not commonly used outside of X.509.\nMove the crypto part of the library (content of tf-psa-crypto directory)\nfrom the Mbed TLS to the TF-PSA-Crypto repository. The crypto code and\ntests development will now occur in TF-PSA-Crypto, which Mbed TLS\nreferences as a Git submodule.\nThe function mbedtls_x509_string_to_names() now requires its head argument\nto point to NULL on entry. This makes it likely that existing risky uses of\nthis function (see the entry in the Security section) will be detected and\nfixed.\nWho should update\nWe recommend all users should update to take advantage of the bug fixes contained in this release at an appropriate point in their development lifecycle.\nNote\n❕\nmbedtls-4.0.0.tar.bz2\nare our official release files.\nsource.tar.gz\nand\nsource.zip\nare automatically generated snapshots that GitHub is generating.

    "content": "Description\nThis release of Mbed TLS provides new features, bug fixes and minor enhancements. This release includes fixes for security issues.\nSecurity Advisories\nThere are no security advisories for this release.\nRelease Notes\nDefault behavior changes\nThe default priority order of TLS 1.3 cipher suites has been modified to\nfollow the same rules as the TLS 1.2 cipher suites (see\nssl_ciphersuites.c). The preferred cipher suite is now\nTLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256.\nNew deprecations\nmbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial() is now being deprecated in favor of\nmbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial_raw(). The goal here is to remove any\ndirect dependency of X509 on BIGNUM_C.\nPSA to mbedtls error translation is now unified in psa_util.h,\ndeprecating mbedtls_md_error_from_psa. Each file that performs error\ntranslation should define its own version of PSA_TO_MBEDTLS_ERR,\noptionally providing file-specific error pairs. Please see psa_util.h for\nmore details.\nFeatures\nAdded partial support for parsing the PKCS\n#7\nCryptographic Message\nSyntax, as defined in RFC 2315. Currently, support is limited to the\nfollowing:\nOnly the signed-data content type, version 1 is supported.\nOnly DER encoding is supported.\nOnly a single digest algorithm per message is supported.\nCertificates must be in X.509 format. A message must have either 0\nor 1 certificates.\nThere is no support for certificate revocation lists.\nThe authenticated and unauthenticated attribute fields of SignerInfo\nmust be empty.\nMany thanks to Daniel Axtens, Nayna Jain, and Nick Child from IBM for\ncontributing this feature, and to Demi-Marie Obenour for contributing\nvarious improvements, tests and bug fixes.\nGeneral performance improvements by accessing multiple bytes at a time.\nFixes\n#1666\n.\nImprovements to use of unaligned and byte-swapped memory, reducing code\nsize and improving performance (depending on compiler and target\narchitecture).\nAdd support for reading points in compressed format\n(MBEDTLS_ECP_PF_COMPRESSED) with mbedtls_ecp_point_read_binary()\n(and callers) for Short Weierstrass curves with prime p where p = 3 mod 4\n(all mbedtls MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP* and MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_BP* curves\nexcept MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP224R1 and MBEDTLS_ECP_DP_SECP224K1)\nSHA224_C/SHA384_C are now independent from SHA384_C/SHA512_C respectively.\nThis helps in saving code size when some of the above hashes are not\nrequired.\nAdd parsing of V3 extensions (key usage, Netscape cert-type,\nSubject Alternative Names) in x509 Certificate Sign Requests.\nUse HOSTCC (if it is set) when compiling C code during generation of the\nconfiguration-independent files. This allows them to be generated when\nCC is set for cross compilation.\nAdd parsing of uniformResourceIdentifier subtype for subjectAltName\nextension in x509 certificates.\nAdd an interruptible version of sign and verify hash to the PSA interface,\nbacked by internal library support for ECDSA signing and verification.\nAdd parsing of rfc822Name subtype for subjectAltName\nextension in x509 certificates.\nThe configuration macros MBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_PLATFORM_FILE and\nMBEDTLS_PSA_CRYPTO_STRUCT_FILE specify alternative locations for\nthe headers \"psa/crypto_platform.h\" and \"psa/crypto_struct.h\".\nWhen a PSA driver for ECDSA is present, it is now possible to disable\nMBEDTLS_ECDSA_C in the build in order to save code size. For PK, X.509\nand TLS to fully work, this requires MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO to be enabled.\nRestartable/interruptible ECDSA operations in PK, X.509 and TLS are not\nsupported in those builds yet, as driver support for interruptible ECDSA\noperations is not present yet.\nAdd a driver dispatch layer for EC J-PAKE, enabling alternative\nimplementations of EC J-PAKE through the driver entry points.\nAdd new API mbedtls_ssl_cache_remove for cache entry removal by\nits session id.\nAdd support to include the SubjectAltName extension to a CSR.\nAdd support for AES with the Armv8-A Cryptographic Extension on\n64-bit Arm. A new configuration option, MBEDTLS_AESCE_C, can\nbe used to enable this feature. Run-time detection is supported\nunder Linux only.\nWhen a PSA driver for EC J-PAKE is present, it is now possible to disable\nMBEDTLS_ECJPAKE_C in the build in order to save code size. For the\ncorresponding TLS 1.2 key exchange to work, MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO needs\nto be enabled.\nAdd functions mbedtls_rsa_get_padding_mode() and mbedtls_rsa_get_md_alg()\nto read non-public fields for padding mode and hash id from\nan mbedtls_rsa_context, as requested in\n#6917\n.\nAES-NI is now supported with Visual Studio.\nAES-NI is now supported in 32-bit builds, or when MBEDTLS_HAVE_ASM\nis disabled, when compiling with GCC or Clang or a compatible compiler\nfor a target CPU that supports the requisite instructions (for example\ngcc -m32 -msse2 -maes -mpclmul). (Generic x86 builds with GCC-like\ncompilers still require MBEDTLS_HAVE_ASM and a 64-bit target.)\nIt is now possible to use a PSA-held (opaque) password with the TLS 1.2\nECJPAKE key exchange, using the new API function\nmbedtls_ssl_set_hs_ecjpake_password_opaque().\nSecurity\nUse platform-provided secure zeroization function where possible, such as\nexplicit_bzero().\nZeroize SSL cache entries when they are freed.\nFix a potential heap buffer overread in TLS 1.3 client-side when\nMBEDTLS_DEBUG_C is enabled. This may result in an application crash.\nAdd support for AES with the Armv8-A Cryptographic Extension on 64-bit\nArm, so that these systems are no longer vulnerable to timing side-channel\nattacks. This is configured by MBEDTLS_AESCE_C, which is on by default.\nReported by Demi Marie Obenour.\nMBEDTLS_AESNI_C, which is enabled by default, was silently ignored on\nbuilds that couldn't compile the GCC-style assembly implementation\n(most notably builds with Visual Studio), leaving them vulnerable to\ntiming side-channel attacks. There is now an intrinsics-based AES-NI\nimplementation as a fallback for when the assembly one cannot be used.\nBugfix\nFix possible integer overflow in mbedtls_timing_hardclock(), which\ncould cause a crash in programs/test/benchmark.\nFix IAR compiler warnings. Fixes\n#6924\n.\nFix a bug in the build where directory names containing spaces were\ncausing generate_errors.pl to error out resulting in a build failure.\nFixes issue\n#6879\n.\nIn TLS 1.3, when using a ticket for session resumption, tweak its age\ncalculation on the client side. It prevents a server with more accurate\nticket timestamps (typically timestamps in milliseconds) compared to the\nMbed TLS ticket timestamps (in seconds) to compute a ticket age smaller\nthan the age computed and transmitted by the client and thus potentially\nreject the ticket. Fix\n#6623\n.\nFix compile error where MBEDTLS_RSA_C and MBEDTLS_X509_CRT_WRITE_C are\ndefined, but MBEDTLS_PK_RSA_ALT_SUPPORT is not defined. Fixes\n#3174\n.\nList PSA_WANT_ALG_CCM_STAR_NO_TAG in psa/crypto_config.h so that it can\nbe toggled with config.py.\nThe key derivation algorithm PSA_ALG_TLS12_ECJPAKE_TO_PMS cannot be\nused on a shared secret from a key agreement since its input must be\nan ECC public key. Reject this properly.\nmbedtls_x509write_crt_set_serial() now explicitly rejects serial numbers\nwhose binary representation is longer than 20 bytes. This was already\nforbidden by the standard (RFC5280 - section 4.1.2.2) and now it's being\nenforced also at code level.\nFix potential undefined behavior in mbedtls_mpi_sub_abs().  Reported by\nPascal Cuoq using TrustInSoft Analyzer in\n#6701\n; observed independently by\nAaron Ucko under Valgrind.\nFix behavior of certain sample programs which could, when run with no\narguments, access uninitialized memory in some cases. Fixes\n#6700\n(which\nwas found by TrustInSoft Analyzer during REDOCS'22) and\n#1120\n.\nFix parsing of X.509 SubjectAlternativeName extension. Previously,\nmalformed alternative name components were not caught during initial\ncertificate parsing, but only on subsequent calls to\nmbedtls_x509_parse_subject_alt_name(). Fixes\n#2838\n.\nMake the fields of mbedtls_pk_rsassa_pss_options public. This makes it\npossible to verify RSA PSS signatures with the pk module, which was\ninadvertently broken since Mbed TLS 3.0.\nFix bug in conversion from OID to string in\nmbedtls_oid_get_numeric_string(). OIDs such as 2.40.0.25 are now printed\ncorrectly.\nReject OIDs with overlong-encoded subidentifiers when converting\nthem to a string.\nReject OIDs with subidentifier values exceeding UINT_MAX.  Such\nsubidentifiers can be valid, but Mbed TLS cannot currently handle them.\nReject OIDs that have unterminated subidentifiers, or (equivalently)\nhave the most-significant bit set in their last byte.\nSilence warnings from clang -Wdocumentation about empty \\retval\ndescriptions, which started appearing with Clang 15. Fixes\n#6960\n.\nFix the handling of renegotiation attempts in TLS 1.3. They are now\nsystematically rejected.\nFix an unused-variable warning in TLS 1.3-only builds if\nMBEDTLS_SSL_RENEGOTIATION was enabled. Fixes\n#6200\n.\nFix undefined behavior in mbedtls_ssl_read() and mbedtls_ssl_write() if\nlen argument is 0 and buffer is NULL.\nAllow setting user and peer identifiers for EC J-PAKE operation\ninstead of role in PAKE PSA Crypto API as described in the specification.\nThis is a partial fix that allows only \"client\" and \"server\" identifiers.\nFix a compilation error when PSA Crypto is built with support for\nTLS12_PRF but not TLS12_PSK_TO_MS. Reported by joerchan in\n#7125\n.\nIn the TLS 1.3 server, select the preferred client cipher suite, not the\nleast preferred. The selection error was introduced in Mbed TLS 3.3.0.\nFix TLS 1.3 session resumption when the established pre-shared key is\n384 bits long. That is the length of pre-shared keys created under a\nsession where the cipher suite is TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.\nFix an issue when compiling with MBEDTLS_SHA512_USE_A64_CRYPTO_IF_PRESENT\nenabled, which required specifying compiler flags enabling SHA3 Crypto\nExtensions, where some compilers would emit EOR3 instructions in other\nmodules, which would then fail if run on a CPU without the SHA3\nextensions. Fixes\n#5758\n.\nChanges\nInstall the .cmake files into CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR/cmake/MbedTLS,\ntypically /usr/lib/cmake/MbedTLS.\nMixed-endian systems are explicitly not supported any more.\nWhen MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO and MBEDTLS_ECDSA_DETERMINISTIC are both\ndefined, mbedtls_pk_sign() now use deterministic ECDSA for ECDSA\nsignatures. This aligns the behaviour with MBEDTLS_USE_PSA_CRYPTO to\nthe behaviour without it, where deterministic ECDSA was already used.\nVisual Studio: Rename the directory containing Visual Studio files from\nvisualc/VS2010 to visualc/VS2013 as we do not support building with versions\nolder than 2013. Update the solution file to specify VS2013 as a minimum.\nprograms/x509/cert_write:\nnow it accepts the serial number in 2 different formats: decimal and\nhex. They cannot be used simultaneously\n\"serial\" is used for the decimal format and it's limted in size to\nunsigned long long int\n\"serial_hex\" is used for the hex format; max length here is\nMBEDTLS_X509_RFC5280_MAX_SERIAL_LEN*2\nThe C code follows a new coding style. This is transparent for users but\naffects contributors and maintainers of local patches. For more\ninformation, see\nhttps://mbed-tls.readthedocs.io/en/latest/kb/how-to/rewrite-branch-for-coding-style/\nChanged the default MBEDTLS_ECP_WINDOW_SIZE from 6 to 2.\nAs tested in issue 6790, the correlation between this define and\nRSA decryption performance has changed lately due to security fixes.\nTo fix the performance degradation when using default values the\nwindow was reduced from 6 to 2, a value that gives the best or close\nto best results when tested on Cortex-M4 and Intel i7.\nWhen enabling MBEDTLS_SHA256_USE_A64_CRYPTO_* or\nMBEDTLS_SHA512_USE_A64_CRYPTO_*, it is no longer necessary to specify\ncompiler target flags on the command line; the library now sets target\noptions within the appropriate modules.\nWho should update\nWe recommend all users should update to take advantage of the bug fixes contained in this release at an appropriate point in their development lifecycle.\nChecksum\nThe SHA256 hashes for the archives are:\n1b899f355022e8d02c4d313196a0a16af86c5a692456fa99d302915b8cf0320a  mbedtls-3.4.0.tar.gz\n9969088c86eb89f6f0a131e699c46ff57058288410f2087bd0d308f65e9fccb5 mbedtls-3.4.0.zip",

    "release_date": "2023-03-18T17:18:11Z",
    "content": "It's been\n7 months\nsince latest raylib release. As usual,\nmany parts of the library have been reviewed and improved\nalong those months. Many issues have been closed, staying under 10 open issues at the moment of this writting and also many PRs from contributors have been received, reviewed and merged into raylib library. Some new functions have been added and some others have been removed to improve library coherence and avoid moving too high level, giving the users the tools to implement advance functionality themselfs over raylib. Again, this is a big release with a considerable amount of changes and improvements. Here it is a small summary highlighting this new\nrayib 4.5\n.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+100\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1340\n!)\n+350\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+6350\n!)\n+25\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n516\n!)\n+40\nfunctions REVIEWED/REDESIGNED\n+40\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n405\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 4.5\n:\nNEW\nImproved ANGLE support on Desktop platforms\n: Support for OpenGL ES 2.0 on Desktop platforms (Windows, Linux, macOS) has been reviewed by\n@wtnbgo\nGitHub user. Now raylib can be compiled on desktop for OpenGL ES 2.0 and linked against\nANGLE\n. This\nsmall\naddition open the door to building raylib for all\nANGLE supported backends: Direct3D 11, Vulkan and Metal\n. Please note that this new feature is still experimental and requires further testing!\nNEW\nCamera module\n: A brand new implementation from scratch for\nrcamera\nmodule, contributed by\n@Crydsch\nGitHub user!\nNew camera system is simpler, more flexible, more granular and more extendable\n. Specific camera math transformations (movement/rotation) have been moved to individual functions, exposing them to users if required. Global state has been removed from the module and standalone usage has been greatly improved; now\nrcamera.h\nsingle-file header-only library can be used externally, independently of raylib. A new\nUpdateCameraPro()\nfunction has been added to address input-dependency of\nUpdateCamera()\n, now advance users have\nfull control over camera inputs and movement/rotation speeds\n!\nNEW\nSupport for M3D models and M3D/GLTF animations\n: 3d models animations support has been a limited aspect of raylib for long time, some versions ago IQM animations were supported but raylib 4.5 also adds support for the brand new\nM3D file format\n, including animations and the long expected support for\nGLTF animations\n! The new M3D file format is\nsimple, portable, feature complete, extensible and open source\n. It also provides a complete set of tools to export/visualize M3D models from/to Blender! Now raylib supports up to\n3 model file-formats with animations\n:\nIQM\n,\nGLTF\nand\nM3D\n.\nNEW\nSupport QOA audio format (import/export)\n: Just a couple of months ago the new\nQOA file format\nwas published, a very simple, portable and open source quite-ok-audio file format. raylib already supports it, added to\nraudio\nmodule and including audio loading from file, loading from memory, streaming from file, streaming from memory and\nexporting to QOA\naudio format.\nBecause simplicity really matters to raylib!\nNEW\nModule for compressed textures loading\n:\nrl_gputex\n, a portable single-file header-only small library to load compressed texture file-formats (DDS, PKM, KTX, PVR, ASTC). Provided functionality is not new to raylib but it was part of the raylib\nrtextures\nmodule, now it has been moved into a separate self-contained library,\nimproving portability\n. Note that this module is only intended to\nload compressed data from files, ready to be uploaded to GPU\n, no compression/decompression functionality is provided. This change is a first step towards a better modularization of raylib library.\nReviewed\nrlgl\nmodule for automatic limits checking\n: Again,\nrlgl\nhas been reviewed to simplify usage. Now users do not need to worry about reaching the internal render-batch limits when they send their triangles to draw 2d/3d,\nrlgl\nmanages it automatically! This change allows a\ngreat simplification for other modules\nlike\nrshapes\n,\nrtextures\nand\nrmodels\nthat do not need to worry about bufffer overflows and can just define as many vertex as desired!\nReviewed\nrshapes\nmodule to minimize the rlgl dependency\n: Now\nrshapes\n2d shapes drawing functions\nonly depend on 6 low-level functions\n:\nrlBegin()\n,\nrlEnd()\n,\nrlVertex3f()\n,\nrlTexCoord2f()\n,\nrlNormal3f()\n,\nrlSetTexture()\n. With only those pseudo-OpenGl 1.1 minimal functionality, everything can be drawn! This improvement converts\nrshapes\nmodule in a\nself-contained, portable shapes-drawing library that can be used independently of raylib\n, as far as entry points for those 6 functions are provided by the user. It even allows to be used for software rendering, with the proper backend!\nAdded data structures validation functions\n: Multiple functions have been added by\n@RobLoach\nGitHub user to ease the validation of raylib data structures:\nIsImageReady()\n,\nIsTextureReady()\n,\nIsSoundReady()\n... Now users have a simple mechanism to\nmake sure data has been correctly loaded\n, instead of checking internal structure values by themselfs.\nAs usual, those are only some highlights but there is much more! New image generators, new color transformation functionality, improved blending support for color/alpha, etc... Make sure to check raylib\nCHANGELOG\nfor a detailed list of changes! Please, note that all breaking changes have been flagged with a\nWARNING\nin the CHANGELOG, specially useful for binding creators!\nraylib keeps improving one more version\nwith a special focus on maintainability and sustainability. Always working towards making the library more\nsimple and easy-to-use\n.\nLet's keep\nenjoying games/tools/graphics programming!\n:)\nNew Contributors\n@trumoose\nmade their first contribution in\n#2640\n@daipom\nmade their first contribution in\n#2643\n@disketteman made their first contribution in\n#2682\n@acejacek\nmade their first contribution in\n#2685\n@skylar779\nmade their first contribution in\n#2687\n@murilluhenrique\nmade their first contribution in\n#2696\n@AQuantumPotato\nmade their first contribution in\n#2701\n@deniska\nmade their first contribution in\n#2702\n@bXi\nmade their first contribution in\n#2719\n@realtradam\nmade their first contribution in\n#2737\n@pure01fx\nmade their first contribution in\n#2741\n@JupiterRider\nmade their first contribution in\n#2745\n@SzieberthAdam\nmade their first contribution in\n#2746\n@hatkidchan\nmade their first contribution in\n#2750\n@Anut-py\nmade their first contribution in\n#2753\n@Its-Kenta\nmade their first contribution in\n#2757\n@IanBand made their first contribution in\n#2761\n@InKryption\nmade their first contribution in\n#2763\n@IsaacTCB\nmade their first contribution in\n#2783\n@RomanAkberov made their first contribution in\n#2786\n@RGDTAB\nmade their first contribution in\n#2787\n@SpexGuy\nmade their first contribution in\n#2793\n@shelvick\nmade their first contribution in\n#2796\n@Pere001\nmade their first contribution in\n#2800\n@jtainer\nmade their first contribution in\n#2797\n@lxmcf\nmade their first contribution in\n#2804\n@simendsjo\nmade their first contribution in\n#2826\n@AlxHnr\nmade their first contribution in\n#2829\n@turborium\nmade their first contribution in\n#2838\n@Wytekol\nmade their first contribution in\n#2846\n@BugraAlptekinSari made their first contribution in\n#2836\n@charles-l\nmade their first contribution in\n#2844\n@wtnbgo\nmade their first contribution in\n#2840\n@ImazighenGhost\nmade their first contribution in\n#2857\n@masoudd\nmade their first contribution in\n#2870\n@KOLANICH\nmade their first contribution in\n#2877\n@PencilAmazing\nmade their first contribution in\n#2882\n@the-argus\nmade their first contribution in\n#2905\n@haved\nmade their first contribution in\n#2909\n@star-tek-mb\nmade their first contribution in\n#2910\n@stickm4n\nmade their first contribution in\n#2914\n@fubark\nmade their first contribution in\n#2939\n@Skaytacium\nmade their first contribution in\n#2951\n@ashn-dot-dev\nmade their first contribution in\n#2958\n@Brian-ED\nmade their first contribution in\n#2962\nFull Changelog\n:\n4.2.0...4.5.0",

    "content": "It's been\n7 months\nsince latest raylib release and\n10 years\nsince raylib 1.0 was officially released... what an adventure! In the last 10 years raylib has improved a lot, new functions have been added, many new features and improvements implemented, up to\n500 contributors\nhave helped to shape the library as it is today.\nraylib 5.0\nis the final result of all this incredible amount of work and dedication. Here it is the summary with the key features and additions of this NEW major version of raylib.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+200\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1540\n!)\n+550\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+6950\n!)\n+35\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n552\n!)\n+60\nfunctions REVIEWED/REDESIGNED\n+80\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n+500\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 5.0\n:\nrcore\nmodule platform-split\n: Probably the biggest raylib redesign in the last 10 years. raylib started as a library targeting 3 desktop platforms:\nWindows\n,\nLinux\nand\nmacOS\n(thanks to\nGLFW\nunderlying library) but with the years support for several new platforms has been added (\nAndroid\n,\nWeb\n,\nRapsberry Pi\n,\nRPI native\n...); lot of the platform code was shared so the logic was all together on\nrcore.c\nmodule, separated by compilation flags. This approach was very handy but also made it very difficult to support new platforms and specially painful for contributors not familiar with the module, navigating +8000 lines of code in a single file. A big redesign was really needed but the amount of work required was humungus and quite scary for a solo-developer like me, moreover considering that everything was working and the chances to break things were really high. Fortunately, some contributors were ready for the task (@ubkp,\n@michaelfiber\n,\n@Bigfoot71\n) and thanks to their initiative and super-hard work, the\nrcore\nplatform split\nhas been possible! This new raylib architecture greatly improves the platforms maintenance but also greatly simplifies the addition of new platforms. A\nplatforms/rcore_template.c\nfile is provided with the required structure and functions to be filled for the addition of new platforms, actually it has been simplified to mostly filling some pre-defined functions:\nInitPlatform()\n,\nClosePlatform\n,\nPollInputEvents\n... Undoubtely,\nthis redesign opens the doors to a new era for raylib\n, letting the users to plug new platforms as desired.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: SDL\n: Thanks to the new\nrcore\nplatform-split, the addition of new platforms/backends to raylib has been greatly simplified. As a proof of concept,\nSDL2\nplatform backend has been added to raylib as an aternative for\nGLFW\nlibrary for desktop builds:\nplatforms/rcore_desktop_sdl\n. Lot of work has been put to provide exactly the same features as the other platforms and carefully test the new implementation. Now\nSDL2\nfans can use this new backend, just providing the required include libraries on compilation and linkage (not included in raylib, like\nGLFW\n).\nSDL\nbackend support also\neases the process of supporting a wider range of platforms\nthat already support\nSDL\n.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: Nintendo Switch (closed source)\n: The addition of the\nSDL\nbackend was quite a challenge but to really verify the robustness and ease of the new platform plugin system, adding support for a console was a more demanding adventure. Surprisingly, only two days of work were required to add support for\nNintendo Switch\nto raylib! Implementation result showed an outstanding level of simplicity, with a\nself-contained module\n(\nrcore_swith.cpp\n) supporting graphics and inputs. Unfortunately this module can not be open-sourced due to licensing restrictions.\nNEW\nSplines drawing and evaluation API\n: A complete set of functions has been added to\ndraw\nand\nevaluate\ndifferent types of splines:\nLinear\n,\nBasis\n,\nCatmull-Rom\n,\nQuadratic Bezier\nand\nCubic Bezier\n. Splines are extremely useful for game development (describe paths, control NPC movement...) but they can also be very useful on tools development (node-conections, elements-movement, 3d modelling, animations...). This was the missing feature on the raylib\nrshapes\nmodule to make it complete! Note that\nrshapes\nmodule can also be used independently of raylib just providing the\nonly 6 functions required for vertex definition and drawing\n.\nNEW\nPseudo-random numbers generator: rprand\n: After several years of users asking for this missing piece, a brand new pseudo-random generator module has been added to raylib.\nrprand\nimplements the\nXoshiro128**\nalgorithm combined with\nSplitMix64\n, specially suited for\nfast software pseudo-random numbers generation\n. The module also implies some useful functions to generate non-repetitive random numbers sequences, functionality exposed by raylib. usage of this module can be controlled by a compilation flag, in case the default libc\nrand()\nfunction was preferred.\nNEW\nAutomation Events System API\n: This new system was first added in\nraylib 4.0\nas an experimental feature but it was a bit clumsy and there was no API exposed to users. For the new\nraylib 5.0\nthe system has been redesigned and\nproper API\nadded for the users. With this new events automation system, users can\nrecord input events for later replay\n, very useful feature for testing automation, tutorials generation, assisted game playing, in-game cinematics, speedruns saving or even AI assited game playing!\nNEW\nraygui 4.0\n: The\nofficial raylib immediate-mode gui library\ndesigned for tools development has been updated to a new version, aligned with raylib 5.0. This new version is a complete redesign of raygui to unify all controls structure and usage, now all controls have the same function signature!.\nraygui\nhas been battle-tested with the development of +12 published tools in the last few years. The tools can be seen and used for free in the\nraylib technologies tools page\n. Worth mentioning that several of those\ntools have been open sourced\nfor anyone to use, compile, contribute or learn how the code works.\nNEW\nraylib web examples functionality\n: Beside the addition of several new examples, the web examples functionality has been improved. Examples have been organized by\ncomplexity level\n, marked with one star for simple examples and up to 4 stars for more complex ones. A new option has been added to web to allow to\nfilter examples by function-name\nusage, to ease the learning process when looking for an usage example of some function. Finally,\nopen-graph metadata\ninformation has been added to all examples individual webpages, improving a the visuals and information when sharing those webpages on social networks, sharing the example screenshot and details.\nAs always, those are only some highlights of the new\nraylib 5.0\nbut there is many more improvements! Support for 16-bit HDR images/textures, SVG loading and scaling support, new OpenGL ES 3.0 graphic backend, new image gradient generators, sound alias loading, improved 3d models loading, multiple optimizations, new bindings, CodeQL integration and much more!\nMake sure to check raylib CHANGELOG for a detailed list of changes!\nUndoubtely, this is the\nbiggest raylib update in 10 years\n. Many new features and improvements with a special focus on maintainabiliy and long-term sustainability.\nUndoubtely, this is the raylib of the future\n.\nEnjoy programming!\n:)\nNew

    "content": "One year after raylib 5.0 release, arribes\nraylib 5.5\n, the next big revision of the library. It's been\n11 years\nsince raylib 1.0 release and in all this time it has never stopped growing and improving. With an outstanding number of new contributors and improvements, it's, again, the biggest raylib release to date.\nSome numbers for this release:\n+270\nclosed issues (for a TOTAL of\n+1810\n!)\n+800\ncommits since previous RELEASE (for a TOTAL of\n+7770\n!)\n+30\nfunctions ADDED to raylib API (for a TOTAL of\n580\n!)\n+110\nfunctions REVIEWED with fixes and improvements\n+140\nnew contributors (for a TOTAL of\n+640\n!)\nHighlights for\nraylib 5.5\n:\nNEW\nraylib pre-configured Windows package\n: The new raylib\nportable and self-contained Windows package\nfor\nraylib 5.5\n, intended for nobel devs that start in programming world, comes with one big addition: support for\nC code building for Web platform with one-single-mouse-click!\nFor the last 10 years, the pre-configured raylib Windows package allowed to edit simple C projects on Notepad++ and easely compile Windows executables with an automatic script; this new release adds the possibility to compile the same C projects for Web platform with a simple mouse click. This new addition\ngreatly simplifies C to WebAssembly project building for new users\n. The\nraylib Windows Installer\npackage can be downloaded for free from\nraylib on itch.io\n.\nNEW\nraylib project creator tool\n: A brand new tool developed to help raylib users to\nsetup new projects in a professional way\n.\nraylib project creator\ngenerates a complete project structure with\nmultiple build systems ready-to-use\nand\nGitHub CI/CD actions pre-configured\n. It only requires providing some C files and basic project parameters! The tools is\nfree and open-source\n, and\nit can be used online\n!.\nNEW\nPlatform backend supported: RGFW\n: Thanks to the\nrcore\nplatform-split implemented in\nraylib 5.0\n,\nadding new platforms backends has been greatly simplified\n, new backends can be added using provided template, self-contained in a single C module, completely portable. A new platform backend has been added:\nRGFW\n.\nRGFW\nis a\nnew single-file header-only portable library\n(\nRGFW.h\n) intended for platform-functionality management (windowing and inputs); in this case for\ndesktop platforms\n(Windows, Linux, macOS) but also for\nWeb platform\n. It adds a new alternative to the already existing\nGLFW\nand\nSDL\nplatform backends.\nNEW\nPlatform backend version supported: SDL3\n: Previous\nraylib 5.0\nadded support for\nSDL2\nlibrary, and\nraylib 5.5\nnot only improves SDL2 functionality, with several issues reviewed, but also adds support for the recently released big SDL update in years:\nSDL3\n. Now users can\nselect at compile time the desired SDL version to use\n, increasing the number of potential platforms supported in the future!\nNEW\nRetro-console platforms supported: Dreamcast, N64, PSP, PSVita, PS4\n: Thanks to the platform-split on\nraylib 5.0\n,\nsupporting new platform backends is easier than ever!\nAlong the raylib\nrlgl\nmodule support for the\nOpenGL 1.1\ngraphics API, it opened the door to\nmultiple homebrew retro-consoles backend implementations!\nIt's amazing to see raylib running on +20 year old consoles like\nDreamcast\n,\nPSP\nor\nPSVita\n, considering the hardware constraints of those platforms and proves\nraylib outstanding versability!\nThose additional platforms can be found in separate repositories and have been created by the amazing programmer Antonio Jose Ramos Marquez (\n@psxdev\n).\nNEW\nGPU Skinning support\n: After lots of requests for this feature, it has been finally added to raylib thanks to the contributor Daniel Holden (\n@orangeduck\n), probably the developer that has further pushed models animations with raylib, developing two amazing tools to visualize and test animations:\nGenoView\nand\nBVHView\n. Adding GPU skinning was a tricky feature, considering it had to be\navailable for all raylib supported platforms\n, including limited ones like Raspberry Pi with OpenGL ES 2.0, where some advance OpenGL features are not available (UBO, SSBO, Transform Feedback) but a multi-platform solution was found to make it possible. A new example,\nmodels_gpu_skinning\nhas been added to illustrate this new functionality. As an extra, previous existing CPU animation system has been greatly improved, multiplying performance by a factor (simplifiying required maths).\nNEW\nraymath\nC++ operators\n: After several requested for this feature, C++ math operators for\nVector2\n,\nVector3\n,\nVector4\n,\nQuaternion\nand\nMatrix\nhas been added to\nraymath\nas an extension to current implementation. Despite being only available for C++ because C does not support it, these operators\nsimplify C++ code when doing math operations\n.\nBeside those new big features,\nraylib 5.5\ncomes with MANY other improvements:\nNormals support on batching system\nClipboard images reading support\nCRC32/MD5/SHA1 hash computation\nGamepad vibration support\nImproved font loading (no GPU required) with BDF fonts support\nTime-based camera movement\nImproved GLTF animations loading\n...and\nmuch much more\n, including\nmany functions reviews and new functions added!\nMake sure to check raylib\nCHANGELOG\nfor a detailed list of changes!\nTo end with, I want to\nthank all the contributors (+640!\n) that along the years have\ngreatly improved raylib\nand pushed it further and better day after day. Thanks to all of them, raylib is the amazing library it is today.\nLast but not least, I want to thank\nraylib sponsors and all the raylib community\nfor their support and continuous engagement with the library, creating and sharing amazing raylib projects on a daily basis.\nThanks for making raylib a great platform to enjoy games/tools/graphic programming!\nAfter 11 years of development,\nraylib 5.5\nis the best raylib ever.\nEnjoy programming with raylib!\n:)\nNew Contributors\n@Kimo-s\nmade their first contribution in\n#3528\n@MrScautHD\nmade their first contribution

    "release_date": "2023-04-04T22:20:32Z",
    "content": "This is a quick fix release. The primary focus is to correct a rare corruption bug in high compression mode, detected by\n@danlark1\n. The probability to generate such a scenario by random chance is extremely low. It evaded months of continuous fuzzer tests, due to the number and complexity of simultaneous conditions required to trigger it. Nevertheless,\n@danlark1\nfrom Google shepherds such a humongous amount of data that he managed to detect a reproduction case (corruptions are detected thanks to the checksum), making it possible for\n@terrelln\nto investigate and fix the bug. Thanks !\nWhile the probability might be very small, corruption issues are nonetheless very serious, so an update to this version is highly recommended, especially if you employ high compression modes (levels 16+).\nWhen the issue was detected, there were a number of other improvements and minor fixes already in the making, hence they are also present in this release. Let’s detail the main ones.\nImproved memory usage and speed for the\n--patch-from\nmode\nV1.5.5\nintroduces memory-mapped dictionaries, by\n@daniellerozenblit\n, for both posix\n#3486\nand windows\n#3557\n.\nThis feature allows\nzstd\nto memory-map large dictionaries, rather than requiring to load them into memory. This can make a pretty big difference for memory-constrained environments operating patches for large data sets.\nIt's mostly visible under memory pressure, since\nmmap\nwill be able to release less-used memory and continue working.\nBut even when memory is plentiful, there are still measurable memory benefits, as shown in the graph below, especially when the reference turns out to be not completely relevant for the patch.\nThis feature is automatically enabled for\n--patch-from\ncompression/decompression when the dictionary is larger than the user-set memory limit. It can also be manually enabled/disabled using\n--mmap-dict\nor\n--no-mmap-dict\nrespectively.\nAdditionally,\n@daniellerozenblit\nintroduces significant speed improvements for\n--patch-from\n.\nAn\nI/O\noptimization in\n#3486\ngreatly  improves\n--patch-from\ndecompression speed on Linux, typically by\n+50%\non large files (~1GB).\nCompression speed is also taken care of, with a dictionary-indexing speed optimization introduced in\n#3545\n. It wildly accelerates\n--patch-from\ncompression, typically doubling speed on large files (~1GB), sometimes even more depending on exact scenario.\nThis speed improvement comes at a slight regression in compression ratio, and is therefore enabled only on non-ultra compression strategies.\nSpeed improvements of middle-level compression for specific scenarios\nThe row-hash match finder introduced in version 1.5.0 for levels 5-12 has been improved in version 1.5.5, enhancing its speed in specific corner-case scenarios.\nThe first optimization (\n#3426\n) accelerates streaming compression using\nZSTD_compressStream\non small inputs by removing an expensive table initialization step. This results in remarkable speed increases for very small inputs.\nThe following scenario measures compression speed of\nZSTD_compressStream\nat level 9 for different sample sizes on a linux platform running an i7-9700k cpu.\nsample size\nv1.5.4\n(MB/s)\nv1.5.5\n(MB/s)\nimprovement\n100\n1.4\n44.8\nx32\n200\n2.8\n44.9\nx16\n500\n6.5\n60.0\nx9.2\n1K\n12.4\n70.0\nx5.6\n2K\n25.0\n111.3\nx4.4\n4K\n44.4\n139.4\nx3.2\n...\n...\n...\n1M\n97.5\n99.4\n+2%\nThe second optimization (\n#3552\n) speeds up compression of incompressible data by a large multiplier. This is achieved by increasing the step size and reducing the frequency of matching when no matches are found, with negligible impact on the compression ratio. It makes mid-level compression essentially inexpensive when processing incompressible data, typically, already compressed data (note: this was already the case for fast compression levels).\nThe following scenario measures compression speed of\nZSTD_compress\ncompiled with\ngcc-9\nfor a ~10MB incompressible sample on a linux platform running an i7-9700k cpu.\nlevel\nv1.5.4\n(MB/s)\nv1.5.5\n(MB/s)\nimprovement\n3\n3500\n3500\nnot a row-hash level (control)\n5\n400\n2500\nx6.2\n7\n380\n2200\nx5.8\n9\n176\n1880\nx10\n11\n67\n1130\nx16\n13\n89\n89\nnot a row-hash level (control)\nMiscellaneous\nThere are other welcome speed improvements in this package.\nFor example,\n@felixhandte\nmanaged to increase processing speed of small files by carefully reducing the nb of system calls  (\n#3479\n). This can easily translate into +10% speed when processing a lot of small files in batch.\nThe Seekable format received a bit of care. It's now much faster when splitting data into very small blocks (\n#3544\n). In an extreme scenario reported by\n@P-E-Meunier\n, it improves processing speed by x90. Even for more \"common\" settings, such as using 4KB blocks on some \"normally\" compressible data like\nenwik\n, it still provides a healthy x2 processing speed benefit. Moreover,\n@dloidolt\nmerged an optimization that reduces the nb of\nI/O\nseek()\nevents during reads (decompression), which is also beneficial for speed.\nThe release is not limited to speed improvements, several loose ends and corner cases were also fixed in this release.

    "release_date": "2025-02-19T21:50:11Z",
    "content": "Zstandard\nv1.5.7\nis a significant release, featuring over 500 commits accumulated over the past year. This update brings enhancements across various domains, including performance, stability, and functionality, and is particularly recommended for 32-bit users due to a bug fix detailed below.\nedit\n: man pages were not properly updated in this package, and are still pointing to\nv1.5.6\n. If you want the\nv1.5.7\nversion, they are updated in\ndev\nbranch, and can be cherry-picked using commit\n6af3842\n. Alternatively, they can also be built locally using\nmake manual\nand\nmake -C programs man\n.\nPerformance Enhancements\nEnhanced Compression Speed for Small Data Blocks\nThe compression speed for small data blocks has been notably improved at fast compression levels, thanks to contributions from\n@TocarIP\n, further extended in\n#4165\n. Below are benchmark results illustrating the performance improvements for level 1 compression on the Silesia corpus, segmented into different block sizes:\nBlock Size\nv1.5.6\nv1.5.7\nImprov.\n4 KB\n280 MB/s\n310 MB/s\n+10%\n8 KB\n328 MB/s\n364 MB/s\n+11%\n16 KB\n360 MB/s\n396 MB/s\n+10%\n32 KB\n383 MB/s\n458 MB/s\n+20%\n64 KB\n423 MB/s\n474 MB/s\n+12%\n128 KB\n460 MB/s\n485 MB/s\n+5%\nThese improvements are particularly beneficial in data centers and databases, where data is often divided into small segments to enhance seekability. A notable example is\nRocksDB\n, which is frequently configured with block sizes around 16 KB. Such systems will experience an immediate performance boost by updating their compression library to\nv1.5.7\n.\nAdditionally, the speed improvements partially extend to dictionary compression, with observed gains ranging from none to +15%.\nSubstantial\n--patch-from\nimprovements\nThe\n--patch-from\nfunctionality of the\nzstd\nCLI allows for differential compression of a file given an older version, similar to\nbsdiff\n. While compression levels impact processing speed and compression ratio as expected, at high compression levels (18+), speed was previously reduced to uncomfortable levels.\nv1.5.7\nlargely mitigates the speed impact of high compression levels 18+, as illustrated in the following scenario, which compresses\nlinux-6.13.tar\nas a difference from\nlinux-6.12.tar\nusing 6 threads:\nlevel\nv1.5.6\nv1.5.7\nImprov.\n18\n210 s\n42.7 s\nx4.9\n19\n273 s\n61.8 s\nx4.4\n20\n310 s\n82.3 s\nx3.8\n21\n365 s\n120 s\nx3.1\nAdditionally, compression ratio of\n--patch-from\nis also substantially improved across the board, including higher compression levels:\nlevel\nv1.5.6\nv1.5.7\nImprov.\n15\n6,383,341\n6,003,514\n6.3%\n16\n5,909,932\n5,421,444\n9.0%\n17\n5,613,879\n5,214,734\n7.7%\n18\n5,584,219\n5,075,507\n10.0%\n19\n5,322,658\n4,724,116\n12.6%\n20\n5,097,236\n4,583,435\n11.2%\n21\n4,648,583\n4,297,672\n8.1%\n22\n4,560,051\n4,225,283\n7.9%\n--max\nN/A\n3,999,476\nCompression ratio improvements for large files\nThe compression ratio has been enhanced slightly for large data across all compression levels, thanks to a refined approach in selecting block boundaries. This improvement is more pronounced at lower compression levels (≤ 15), where the previous boundary selection method was relatively basic. In contrast, higher compression levels (16+) already employed some analysis, but still benefit from the introduction of the new heuristic, resulting in marginally better compression ratios.\nA comparison of the compression ratios between\nv1.5.6\nand\nv1.5.7\nis presented below:\nlevel\nv1.5.6\nv1.5.7\nImprov.\n1\n73,492,125\n73,292,801\n-199,324\n3\n66,555,241\n66,217,754\n-337,487\n6\n61,614,472\n61,350,571\n-263,901\n8\n60,089,890\n59,816,878\n-273,012\n12\n58,297,345\n58,039,924\n-257,421\n15\n57,290,517\n57,031,235\n-259,282\n16\n55,341,618\n55,304,857\n-36,761\n19\n52,876,557\n52,840,800\n-35,757\n22\n52,326,420\n52,289,718\n-36,702\nCommand-Line Interface Updates\nRecognizing the prevalence of multi-core systems,\nzstd\nnow employs\nmultiple threads by default\n, thanks to\n#4211\nby\n@daniellerozenblit\nIn\nv1.5.7\n, systems will see default threading scaled according to capability, but remains cautious to mitigate risks of overloading surprises on existing user base, with a maximum of 4 threads by default.\nFor example, a typical \"low-end\" system with 4 cores and hyperthreading will employ 2 threads by default. A \"higher-end\" system with 8 cores and hyperthreading will employ 4 threads by default.\nThese modifications only impact default settings. As usual, the number of threads that\nzstd\nuses can also be set manually, either via command line or via environment variables.\nAdditionally, a new\nzstd\ncommand\n--max\nis available, designed to maximize compression ratios by leveraging all parameters, at the expense of time and memory. It's slower and more resource hungry than\n--ultra -22\n, but achieves denser compressed archives if that's the goal. For instance, compressing\nenwik9\n(1,000,000,000 bytes) at\n--max\nlevel on a i7-9700k platform yields:\nlevel\ncSize\ncTime\ncMem\n--ultra -22\n213,898,083\n~6 mn\n~ 3 GB\n--max\n202,507,076\n~72 mn\n~ 18 GB\nBug Fixes\nv1.5.7\nresolves a long standing and very rare compression issue in 32-bit mode, which can be triggered during long-lasting sessions (same\nZSTD_CCtx*\nbeing continuously reused). This issue required several conditions to be met and a large amount of data to occur, but at the scale of\nzstd\nusage, it has been observed and reported (\n#4292\n).\nIn summary, if you use\nlibzstd\nin 32-bit mode, this update is highly recommended.\nMiscellaneous\nThe release also brings its lot of various improvements, impacting build scripts (cmake, meson, Apple Framework, Visual Studio), documentation and portability (QNX, FreeBSD, Hurd, icc/icx).\nNotably, there are measurable performance gains for binaries produced with Visual Studio, as a cumulative result of several contributions.\nChangelog:\nfix: compression bug in 32-bit mode associated with long-lasting sessions\nperf: substantial compression speed improvements (up to +30%) on small data, by\n@TocarIP\n(\n#4144\n) and\n@Cyan4973\n(\n#4165\n)\nperf: improved compression speed (~+5%) for dictionary compression at low levels (\n#4170\n)\nperf: much faster\n--patch-from\nat high compression levels (\n#4276\n)\nperf: higher\n--patch-from\ncompression ratios, notably at high levels (\n#4288\n)\nperf: better speed for binaries on Windows (\n@pps83\n) and when compiled with Visual Studio (\n@MessyHack\n)\nperf: slightly improve compression ratio across all levels thanks to better block boundaries (\n#4136\n,\n#4176\n,\n#4178\n)\nperf: slight compression ratio improvement for\ndfast\n, aka levels 3 and 4 (\n#4171\n)\nperf: runtime bmi2 detection now also enabled on x86 32-bit mode (\n#4251\n)\ncli: multi-threading as default CLI setting, by\n@daniellerozenblit\ncli: new\n--max\ncommand (\n#4290\n)\napi: new method\nZSTD_compressSequencesAndLiterals()\n(\n#4217\n,\n#4232\n)\napi:\nZSTD_getFrameHeader()\nnow works on skippable frames (\n#4228\n)\nbuild: improve\nmsbuild\nversion autodetection, support VS2022, by\n@ManuelBlanc\nbuild: fix\nmeson\nbuild by\n@artem\nand\n@Victor-C-Zhang\n, and on Windows by\n@bgilbert\nbuild: compatibility with Apple Framework, by\n@Treata11\nbuild: improve icc/icx compatibility, by\n@josepho0918\nand\n@luau-project\nbuild: improve compatibility with Android NDK, by Adenilson Cavalcanti\nportability: linux kernel branch, with improved support for Sequence producers (\n@embg\n,\n@gcabiddu\n,\n@Cyan4973\n)\nportability: improved qnx compatibility, suggested by\n@rainbowball\nportability: improved install script for FreeBSD, by\n@sunpoet\nportability: fixed test suite compatibility with gnu hurd, by\n@diegonc\ndoc: clarify specification, by\n@elasota\nmisc: improved tests/decodecorpus validation tool (\n#4102\n), by antmicro\nNew Contributors\n@ManuelBlanc\nmade their first contribution in\n#3987\n@sunpoet\nmade their first contribution in\n#3994\n@georgthegreat\nmade their first contribution in\n#3998\n@pstef\nmade their first contribution in\n#4021\n@Ansuel\nmade their first contribution in\n#4020\n@b7f7\nmade their first contribution in\n#4019\n@bgilbert\nmade their first contribution in\n#3931\n@alexlnkp made their first contribution in\n#4025\n@r-barnes\nmade their first contribution in\n#4034\n@Adenilson\nmade their first contribution in\n#4050\n@Federico-Maresca\nmade their first contribution in\n#4039\n@jbajic\nmade their first contribution in\n#4054\n@tpetazzoni\nmade their first contribution in\n#4096\n@uilianries\nmade their first contribution in\n#4101\n@jclab-joseph\nmade their first contribution in\n#4087\n@RubenKelevra\nmade their first contribution in\n#4094\n@proppy\nmade their first contribution in\n#4102\n@xionghul\nmade their first contribution in\n#4119\n@inventor500\nmade their first contribution in\n#4134\n@dearblue\nmade their first contribution in\n#4154\n@artem\nmade their first contribution in\n#4153\n@lukaso\nmade their first contribution in\n#4191\n@jimis\nmade their first contribution in\n#4199\n@nhz2\nmade their first contribution in\n#4202\n@rorosen\nmade their first contribution in\n#4201\n@medns\nmade their first contribution in\n#4118\n@Victor-C-Zhang\nmade their first contribution in\n#4210\n@kevinjzhang\nmade their first contribution in\n#4213\n@diegonc\nmade their first contribution in\n#4212\n@RicBent\nmade their first contribution in\n#4220\n@yotann\nmade their first contribution in\n#4080\n@MessyHack\nmade their first contribution in\n#4234\n@szsam\nmade their first contribution in\n#4238\n@lalakii\nmade their first contribution in\n#4242\n@pps83\nmade their first contribution in\n#4246\n@Treata11\nmade their first contribution in\n#4259\n@gcabiddu\nmade their first contribution in\n#4260\n@luau-project\nmade their first contribution in\n#4269\n@tsdgeos\nmade their first contribution in\n#4271\nFull Changelog\n:\nv1.5.6...v1.5.7",

    "release_date": "2024-03-30T18:57:28Z",
    "content": "This release highlights the deployment of Google\nChrome 123\n, introducing\nzstd-encoding\nfor Web traffic, offered as a preferable option for compression of dynamic contents. With limited web server support for\nzstd-encoding\ndue to its novelty, we are launching an updated Zstandard version to facilitate broader adoption.\nImproved latency (time to first delivered byte) for web pages\nUsing\nzstd\ncompression for large documents over the Internet, data is segmented into smaller blocks. This is crucial for applications like Chrome that process parts of documents as they arrive. However, blocks can have a size of up to 128 KB by default, which can be large for congested networks.\nTo mitigate such scenarios and improve \"time to first delivered byte\",\nlibzstd\nintroduces the new\nparameter\nZSTD_c_targetCBlockSize\n, enabling the division of blocks into even smaller segments, resulting in desirable latency reduction, notably beneficial in areas with more congested network infrastructure.\nThis parameter must be set explicitly, because it is not free: it incurs a small cpu cost (equivalent to -2% speed at level 8) and a small compression efficiency decrease (<0.1%), both of which look reasonable but nonetheless non-zero.\nImproved compression ratio at high levels\nHighest compression levels (typically 18+) receive some compression ratio improvement. The improvement is\nreally noticeable for 32-bit structures\n, like arrays of\nint\nfor example. A real-world example would the\n.debug_str_offsets\nsection of\nDWARF\ndebug info within\nELF\nexecutables, mentioned in\n#2832\n, for which the compression effectiveness increases by +35%. It's not rare for many files or objects to contain sections of 32-bit structures, resulting in corresponding compression ratio improvements.\nGranular binary size selection\nlibzstd\nprovides build customization, including options to compile only the compression or decompression modules, minimizing binary size. Enhanced in\nv1.5.6\n(\nsource\n), it now allows for even finer control by enabling selective inclusion or exclusion of specific components within these modules. This advancement aids applications needing precise binary size management.\nMiscellaneous Enhancements\nThis release includes various minor enhancements and bug fixes to enhance user experience. Key updates include an expanded list of recognized compressed file suffixes for the\n--exclude-compressed\nflag, improving efficiency by skipping presumed incompressible content. Furthermore, compatibility has been broadened to include additional chipsets (\nsparc64\n,\nARM64EC\n,\nrisc-v\n) and operating systems (\nQNX\n,\nAIX\n,\nSolaris\n,\nHP-UX\n).\nChange Log\napi:
