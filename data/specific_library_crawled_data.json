The fullstack crate contains adapters for communicating with your\nFullstack Rendering\nThe fullstack crate makes it dead simple to create a server side rendered hydrated app with fullstack typesafety. The fullstack crate lets you render your page on the server on every request (or incrementally) and then hydrate it on the client.\nuse\ndioxus\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nuse\ndioxus_fullstack\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nfn\nmain\n(\n)\n{\nLaunchBuilder\n::\nnew\n(\napp\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nfn\napp\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nmut\ncount =\nuse_state\n(\ncx\n,\n||\n0\n)\n;\nrender\n!\n{\nh1\n{\n\"High-Five counter: {count}\"\n}\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| count +=\n1\n,\n\"Up high!\"\n}\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| count -=\n1\n,\n\"Down low!\"\n}\n}\n}\nFullstack communication\nIn addition to fullstack rendering, the new fullstack create allows you to communicate with your server effortlessly. You can annotate a function with\n#[server]\nto make the code inside the function only run on the server. This makes it easy to build a backend for your web or desktop application!\nuse\ndioxus\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nuse\ndioxus_fullstack\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nfn\nmain\n(\n)\n{\nLaunchBuilder\n::\nnew\n(\napp\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nfn\napp\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nmut\ncount =\nuse_state\n(\ncx\n,\n||\n0\n)\n;\nrender\n!\n{\nh1\n{\n\"High-Five counter: {count}\"\n}\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| count +=\n1\n,\n\"Up high!\"\n}\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| count -=\n1\n,\n\"Down low!\"\n}\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_|\n{\nto_owned!\n[\ncount\n]\n;\nasync\nmove\n{\nlet\ndouble = double\n(\n*\ncount\n)\n.\nawait\n.\nunwrap\n(\n)\n;\ncount\n.\nset\n(\ndouble\n)\n;\n}\n}\n}\n}\n}\n#\n[\nserver\n]\nasync\nfn\ndouble\n(\nnumber\n:\nusize\n)\n->\nResult\n<\nusize\n,\nServerFnError\n>\n{\n// This will *only* run on the server\nOk\n(\nnumber\n*\n2\n)\n}\nSuspense\n0.4 adds the long awaited suspense feature. This allows you to wait for a future on the server and then send the result to the client. You can combine suspense with server functions to wait for some code on your server to finish running before rendering a component:\nuse\ndioxus\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nuse\ndioxus_fullstack\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nfn\nmain\n(\n)\n{\nLaunchBuilder\n::\nnew\n(\napp\n)\n.\nlaunch\n(\n)\n;\n}\nfn\napp\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nmut\nserver_data =\nuse_server_future\n(\ncx\n,\n||\nget_server_data\n(\n)\n)\n?\n;\nrender\n!\n{\ndiv\n{\n\"{server_data:?}\"\n}\n}\n}\n#\n[\nserver\n]\nasync\nfn\nget_server_data\n(\n)\n->\nResult\n<\nusize\n,\nServerFnError\n>\n{\nOk\n(\n42\n)\n}\nCLI Improvements\nThe Dioxus CLI has moved into the dioxus main repo\nThe Dioxus CLI is now called\ndx\ninstead of\ndioxus\n. The 0.4 release of the Dioxus CLI added three main features:\nDioxus Check\n@eventualbuddha\nhas done a fantastic job creating a new Dioxus check command to lint your Dioxus code for errors! It will warn you if your code violates the\nrules of hooks\ndx check\nDioxus Bundle\nThe Dioxus CLI can now create installers for MacOs and Windows powered by\ntauri-bundle\n!\ndioxus bundle\nDesktop Hot Reload\nIn Dioxus 0.4, rsx hot reloading has moved from the hot reload macro to the CLI for desktop, liveview, fullstack, and TUI applications. Now every platform can use the CLI to start hot reloading:\ndioxus serve --platform desktop --hot-reload\nMobile\nDioxus now has improved mobile support with a getting started guide and a mobile example!\nDocumentation\nThe documentation has been revamped for the 0.4 release. We now have a short getting started guide that teaches you how to build a hackernews clone in Dioxus.\nThe new documentation site takes full advantage of the fullstack crate to prerender the pages.\nWhile working on the new docsite we also created two new crates:\nDioxus Mdbook\nmakes it easy to use markdown into your Dioxus components and use Dioxus components in your markdown\nDioxus Search\nmakes it easy to create instant search indexes for your Dioxus page's. It integrates with the Dioxus router's new site map feature to automatically detect searchable pages\nTogether these crates allow us to make our documentation fully interactive and instantly searchable. The new documentation site contains live code snippets of different components as you walk through the guide.\nDioxus STD\nOne of the biggest problems with cross platform development in rust today is finding ergonomic ways to interact with system APIs.\n@doge\nand\n@marc\nhave created a new Dioxus std create that makes it easy to interact with a variety of system APIs in Dioxus across all platforms. It contains helpers for Geolocation, clipboard access, notifications, color schemes, translation, and more!\nAsync Eval\n@doge\nhas made the use_eval hook significantly more powerful for the 0.4 release of Dioxus. You can now send messages to and from Javascript asynchronously. This feature makes it possible to listen for Javascript events that Dioxus doesn’t officially support (for example the intersection observer API).\nDioxus HTML\nThe 0.4 release introduces file upload support for the dioxus-html crate. This makes it easy to upload files to you desktop, liveview, or web application.\nThis release also introduces a new onmounted event that provides access to some common node APIs like focusing an element or getting the size of an element in a cross platform way.\nRink and Blitz-core\nDioxus' TUI renderer Rink and WGPU renderer Blitz can now be used without Dioxus. This makes it possible to render your own html into either of these renderers or use these renderers in your own framework. To get started, see the\nBlitz\nand\nRink\nframework-less examples.\nCommunity\nOffice Hours\nDioxus now holds weekly office hours in the discord! If you are interested in the project, need help with your projects, or want to get started contributing, you should come to our weekly office hours!\nThe office hours happen every Friday at 9:00 AM (PDT) in the\nDioxus discord server\nRecordings of office hours are available on the\nDioxus youtube channel\nNew contributors\nThere have been almost 50 new contributors since the 0.3 release!\n@mirkootter\n,\n@davidpdrsn\n,\n@mwcz\n,\n@askreet\n,\n@marcerhans\n,\n@ndarilek\n,\n@arniu\n,\n@pickfire\n,\n@arqalite\n,\n@ProfXwing\n,\n@Icekey\n,\n@willothy\n,\n@rtwfroody\n,\n@attilio\n, @stephenandary,\n@Rigellute\n,\n@onweru\n,\n@Byron\n,\n@nicoburns\n,\n@serzhiio\n,\n@indiv0\n,\n@azriel91\n,\n@elliotwaite\n,\n@nmlt\n,\n@nicholastmosher\n,\n@TimothyStiles\n,\n@jpearnshaw\n,\n@jmsfltchr\n,\n@striezel\n,\n@echochamber\n,\n@xinglixing\n,\n@sean\n,\n@torsteingrindvik\n,\n@vanhouc\n,\n@terhechte\n,\n@traxys\n,\n@Mouradost\n,\n@dianqk\n,\n@eventualbuddha\n,\n@leahiel\n,\n@kaid\n,\n@frisoft\n,\n@Niedzwiedzw\nConclusion\nFor more information on the 0.4 release and all the new features that have been introduced,\nread the blogpost\nFull Changelog\n:\nv0.3.2...v0.4.0",

    "content": "Dioxus 0.5: Signal Rewrite, Remove lifetimes/unsafe, CSS Hotreloading, 5x Faster Desktop,  Asset System, and more!\nRead the Full 0.5 release post on the Dioxus blog\nThe story\nHere at Dioxus Labs, we have an unofficial rule: only one rewrite per year.\nOur last rewrite brought some amazing features: templates, hotreloading, and insane performance. However, don’t be mistaken, rewrites are scary, time consuming, and a huge gamble. We started this new rewrite on January 1st of 2024, completed it by Feburary 1st, and then spent another month and a half writing tests, squashing bugs, and polishing documentation. Rewrites are absolutely not for the faint of heart.\nIf you’re new here, Dioxus (dye•ox•us) is a library for building GUIs in Rust. Originally, I built Dioxus as a rewrite of Yew with the intention of supporting proper server-side-rendering. Eventually, Dioxus got popular, we got some amazing sponsors, and I went full time. We’ve grown from a team of 1 (me) to a team of 4(!) - pulled entirely from the wonderful dioxus community.\nNow, Dioxus is something a little different. Real life, actual companies are shipping web apps, desktop apps, and mobile apps with Dioxus. What was once just a fun little side project powers a small fraction of apps out in the wild. We now have lofty goals of simplifying the entire app development ecosystem. Web, Desktop, Mobile, all end-to-end typesafe, blazing fast, living under one codebase. The dream!\nWith 0.5 we took a hard look at how Dioxus would need to change to achieve those goals. The request we got from the community was clear: make it simpler, make it robust, make it polished.\nWhat’s new?\nThis is probably the biggest release of Dioxus ever, with so many new features, bug fixes, and improvements that I can’t list them all. We churned over 100,000 lines of code (yes, 100,000+) with over 1,400 commits between 0.4.3 and 0.5.0. Here’s a quick overview:\nComplete rewrite of\ndioxus-core\n, removing all unsafe code\nAbandoning\nuse_state\nand\nuse_ref\nfor a clone-free\nSignal\n-based API\nRemoval of all lifetimes and the\ncx: Scope\nstate\nA single, unified\nlaunch\nfunction that starts your app for any platform\nAsset hotreloading that supports Tailwind and Vanilla CSS\nRewrite of events, allowing access to the native\nWebSys\nevent types\nExtension of components with element properties (IE a Link now takes all of\n<a/>\nproperties)\nIntegrated Error Boundaries and Server Futures with Suspense integration\n5x faster desktop reconciliation and custom asset handlers for streaming bytes\nStreaming server functions and fullstack hotreloading\nTons of QoL improvements, bug fixes, and more!\n💡 If you are updating from DIoxus 0.4, a\nmigration guide\nis available\nLifetime Problems\nTo make Dioxus simpler, we wanted to remove lifetimes entirely. Newcomers to rust are easily scared off by lifetime issues, and even experienced Rustaceans find wading through obtuse error messages exhausting.\nIn dioxus 0.1-0.4, every value in a component lives for a\n'bump\nlifetime. This lifetime lets you easily use hooks, props and the scope within event listeners without cloning anything. It was the chief innovation that made Dioxus so much easier to use than Yew when it was released.\n// Scope and Element have the lifetime 'bump\nfn\nOldDioxusComponent\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// hook has the lifetime 'bump\nlet\nmut\nstate =\nuse_state\n(\ncx\n,\n||\n0\n)\n;\ncx\n.\nrender\n(\nrsx\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\n// The closure has the lifetime 'bump which means you don't\n// need to clone hook before you move it into the closure\nonclick\n:\nmove |_event|\n*\nstate +=\n1\n,\n}\n}\n)\n}\nThis works great for hooks\nmost\nof the time. The lifetime lets you omit a bunch of manual clones every time you want to use a value inside an EventHandler (onclick, oninput, etc).\nHowever, the lifetime doesn’t work for futures. Futures in dioxus need to be\n'static\nwhich means you always need to clone values before you use them in the future. Since a future might need to run while the component is rendering, it can’t share the component’s lifetime.\n// Scope and Element have the lifetime 'bump\nfn\nOldDioxusComponent\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// state has the lifetime 'bump\nlet\nstate =\nuse_state\n(\ncx\n,\n||\n0\n)\n;\ncx\n.\nspawn\n(\n{\n// Because state has the lifetime 'bump, we need to clone it to make it\n// 'static before we move it into the 'static future\nlet\nstate = state\n.\nclone\n(\n)\n;\nasync\nmove\n{\nprintln\n!\n(\n\"{state}\"\n)\n;\n}\n}\n)\n;\n// ...\n}\nIf you don’t clone the value, you will run into an error like this:\n4\n|   fn\nOldDioxusComponent\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n|                         --\n   |                         |\n   |                         `cx` is a reference that is only valid\nin\nthe function body\n   |                         has type `\n&\n'\n1\nScoped\n<\n'\n1\n>`\n...\n8\n| /     cx\n.\nspawn\n(\nasync\nmove\n{\n9\n| |\nprintln\n!\n(\n\"{state}\"\n)\n;\n10\n| |\n}\n)\n;\n| |      ^\n   | |      |\n   | |______`cx` escapes the function body here\n   |        argument requires that `\n'\n1\n` must outlive `\n'\nstatic\n`\nThe error complains that\ncx\nmust outlive\n'static\nwithout mentioning the hook at all which can be very confusing.\nDioxus 0.5 fixes this issue by first removing scopes and the\n'bump\nlifetime and then introducing a new\nCopy\nstate management solution called signals. Here is what the component looks like in dioxus 0.5:\n// Element has no lifetime, and you don't need a Scope\nfn\nNewComponent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// state is 'static and Copy, even if the inner value you store is not Copy\nlet\nmut\nstate =\nuse_signal\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\n// State is already 'static and Copy, so it is copied into the future automatically\nspawn\n(\nasync\nmove\n{\nprintln\n!\n(\n\"{state}\"\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\n// The closure has the lifetime 'static, but state is copy so you don't need to clone into the closure\nonclick\n:\nmove |_event| state +=\n1\n,\n}\n}\n}\nWhile this might seem like a rather innocuous change, it has an impressively huge impact on how easy it is to write new components. I’d say building a new Dioxus app is about 2-5x easier with this change alone.\nGoodbye scopes and lifetimes!\nIn the new version of dioxus, scopes and the\n'bump\nlifetime have been removed! This makes declaring a component and using runtime functions within that component much easier:\nYou can now declare a component by just accepting your props directly instead of a scope parameter\n#\n[\ncomponent\n]\nfn\nMyComponent\n(\nname\n:\nString\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"Hello {name}!\"\n}\n}\nAnd inside that component, you can use runtime functions directly\nspawn\n(\nasync\nmove\n{\ntokio\n::\ntime\n::\nsleep\n(\nDuration\n::\nfrom_millis\n(\n100\n)\n)\n.\nawait\n;\n// You can even use runtime functions inside futures and event handlers!\nlet\ncontext\n:\ni32\n=\nconsume_context\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\nNow that lifetimes are gone,\nElement\ns are\n'static\nwhich means you can use them in hooks or even provide them through the context API. This makes some APIs like\nvirtual lists in dioxus\nsignificantly easier. We expect more interesting APIs to emerge from the community now that you don’t need to be a Rust wizard to implement things like virtualization and offscreen rendering.\nRemoval of all Unsafe in Core\nRemoving the\n'bump\nlifetime along with the scope gave us a chance to remove a lot of unsafe from dioxus.\ndioxus-core 0.5 contains no unsafe code 🎉\nThere’s still a tiny bit of unsafe floating around various dependencies that we plan to remove throughout the 0.5 release cycle, but way less: all quite simple to cut or unfortunately necessary due to FFI.\nSignals!\nDioxus 0.5 introduces Signals as the core state primitive for components. Signals have two key advantages over the existing\nuse_state\nand\nuse_ref\nhooks: They are always\nCopy\nand they don’t require manual subscriptions.\nCopy state\nSignal<T>\nis\nCopy\n, even if the inner\nT\nvalues is not. This is enabled by our new\ngenerational-box\ncrate (implemented with zero unsafe). Signals can even optionally be\nSend+Sync\nif you need to move them between threads, removing the need for a whole class of specialized state management solutions.\nThe combination of\nCopy + Send + Sync\nSignals, and static components makes it incredibly easy to move state to anywhere you need it:\nfn\nParent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// We use a sync signal here so that we can use it in other threads,\n// but you could use a normal signal if you have !Send data\nlet\nmut\nstate =\nuse_signal_sync\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\nspawn\n(\nasync\nmove\n{\n// Signals have a ton of helper methods that make them easy to work with.\n// You can call a signal like a function to get the current value\nlet\nvalue\n:\ni32\n=\nstate\n(\n)\n;\n}\n)\n;\n// Because signals can be sync, we can copy them into threads easily\nstd\n::\nthread\n::\nspawn\n(\nmove\n||\n{\nloop\n{\nstd\n::\nthread\n::\nsleep\n(\nDuration\n::\nfrom_millis\n(\n100\n)\n)\n;\nprintln\n!\n(\n\"{state}\"\n)\n;\n}\n}\n)\n;\nrender\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\n// You can easily move it into an event handler just like use_state\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| state +=\n1\n}\n}\n}\nWith\nCopy\nstate, we’ve essentially bolted on a light form of garbage collection into Rust that uses component lifecycles as the triggers for dropping state. From a memory perspective, this is basically the same as 0.4, but with the added benefit of not needing to explicitly\nClone\nanything.\nSmarter subscriptions\nSignals are smarter about what components rerun when they are changed. A component will only rerun if you read the value of the signal in the component (not in an async task or event handler). In this example, only the child will re-render when the button is clicked because only the child component is reading the signal:\nfn\nParent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nmut\nstate =\nuse_signal\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| state +=\n1\n,\n\"increment\"\n}\nChild\n{\nstate\n}\n}\n}\n#\n[\ncomponent\n]\nfn\nChild\n(\nstate\n:\nSignal\n<\ni32\n>\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"{state}\"\n}\n}\nSmarter subscriptions let us merge several different hooks into signals. For example, we were able to remove an entire crate dedicated to state management: Fermi. Fermi provided what was essentially a\nuse_state\nAPI where statics were used as keys. This meant you could declare some global state, and then read it in your components:\nstatic\nCOUNT\n:\nAtom\n<\ni32\n>\n=\nAtom\n::\nnew\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\nfn\nDemo\n(\ncx\n:\nScope\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nmut\ncount =\nuse_read_atom\n(\ncx\n,\n&\nCOUNT\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"{count}\"\n}\n}\nSince fermi didn’t support smart subscriptions, you had to explicitly declare use the right\nuse_read\n/\nuse_write\nhooks to subscribe to the value. In Dioxus 0.5, we just use signals, eliminating the need for any sort of external state management solution altogether.\n// You can use a lazily initialized signal called\n// GlobalSignal in static instead of special Fermi atoms\nstatic\nCOUNT\n:\nGlobalSignal\n<\ni32\n>\n=\nSignal\n::\nglobal\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\n// Using the GlobalSignal is just the same as any other signal!\n// No need for use_read or use_write\nfn\nDemo\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"{COUNT}\"\n}\n}\nSignals even work with the context API, so you can quickly share state between components in your app:\nfn\nParent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// Create a new signal and provide it to the context API\n// without a special use_shared_state hook\nlet\nmut\nstate =\nuse_context_provider\n(\n||\nSignal\n::\nnew\n(\n0\n)\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |_| state +=\n1\n,\n\"Increment\"\n}\nChild\n{\n}\n}\n}\nfn\nChild\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// Get the state from the context API\nlet\nstate =\nuse_context\n::\n<\nSignal\n<\ni32\n>\n>\n(\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"{state}\"\n}\n}\nSmart subscriptions also apply to hooks. Hooks like\nuse_future\nand\nuse_memo\nwill now automatically add signals you read inside the hook to the dependencies of the hook:\n// You can use a lazily initialized signal called GlobalSignal in static instead of special Fermi atoms\nstatic\nCOUNT\n:\nGlobalSignal\n<\ni32\n>\n=\nSignal\n::\nglobal\n(\n||\n0\n)\n;\nfn\nApp\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\n// Because we read COUNT inside the memo, it is automatically added to the memo's dependencies\n// If we change COUNT, then the memo knows it needs to rerun\nlet\nmemo =\nuse_memo\n(\nmove\n||\nCOUNT\n(\n)\n/\n2\n)\n;\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"{memo}\"\n}\n}\nEvent System Rewrite\nSince it’s release, dioxus has used a synthetic event system to create a cross platform event API. Synthetic events can be incredibly useful to make events work across platforms and even serialize them across the network, but they do have some drawbacks.\nDioxus 0.5 finally exposes the underlying event type for each platform along with a trait with a cross platform API. This has two advantages:\nYou can get whatever information you need from the platform event type or pass that type to another library:\nfn\nButton\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nbutton\n{\nonclick\n:\nmove |event|\n{\nlet\nweb_sys_event\n:\nweb_sys\n::\nMouseEvent\n= event\n.\nweb_event\n(\n)\n;\nweb_sys\n::\nconsole\n::\nlog_1\n(\n&\nweb_sys_event\n.\nrelated_target\n.\ninto\n(\n)\n)\n;\n}\n}\n}\n}\nDioxus can bundle split code for events apps don’t use. For a hello world example, this shrinks the gzipped size ~25%!\nAgain, this seems like a small change on the surface, but opens up dozens of new use cases and possible libraries you can build with dioxus.\n💡 The\nDioxus optimization guide\nhas tips to help you make the smallest possible bundle\nCross platform launch\nDioxus 0.5 introduces a new cross platform API to launch your app. This makes it easy to target multiple platforms with the same application. Instead of pulling in a separate renderer package, you can now enable a feature on the dioxus crate and call the launch function from the prelude:\n[\ndependencies\n]\ndioxus\n=\n\"\n0.5\n\"\n[\nfeatures\n]\ndefault\n= []\ndesktop\n= [\n\"\ndioxus/desktop\n\"\n]\nfullstack\n= [\n\"\ndioxus/fullstack\n\"\n]\nserver\n= [\n\"\ndioxus/axum\n\"\n]\nweb\n= [\n\"\ndioxus/web\n\"\n]\nuse\ndioxus\n::\nprelude\n::\n*\n;\nfn\nmain\n(\n)\n{\ndioxus\n::\nlaunch\n(\n||\nrsx\n!\n{\n\"hello world\"\n}\n)\n}\nWith that single application, you can easily target:\n#\nDesktop\ndx serve --platform desktop\n#\nSPA web\ndx serve --platform web\n#\nOr a fullstack application\ndx serve --platform fullstack\nThe CLI is now smart enough to automatically pass in the appropriate build features depending on the platform you’re targeting.\nAsset System Beta\nCurrently assets in dioxus (and web applications in general) can be difficult to get right. Links to your asset can easily get out of date, the link to your asset can be different between desktop and web applications, and you need to manually add assets you want to use into your bundled application. In addition to all of that, assets can be a huge performance bottleneck.\nLets take a look at the dioxus mobile guide in the docsite as an example:\nThe 0.4 mobile guide takes 7 seconds to load and transfers 9 MB of resources. The page has 6 different large image files which slows down the page loading times significantly. We could switch to a more optimized image format like\navif\n, but manually converting every screenshot is tedious and time consuming.\nLets take a look at the 0.5 mobile guide with the new asset system:\nThe new mobile guide takes less than 1 second to load and requires only 1/3 of the resources with the exact same images!\nDioxus 0.5 introduces a new asset system called\nmanganis\n. Manganis integrates with the CLI to check, bundle and optimize assets in your application. The API is currently unstable so the asset system is currently published as a separate crate. In the new asset system, you can just wrap your assets in the\nmg!\nmacro and they will automatically be picked up by the CLI. You can read more about the new asset system in the\nmanganis docs\n.\nAs we continue to iterate on the 0.5 release, we plan to add hot reloading to manganis assets, so you can interactively add new the features to your app like CSS, images, tailwind classes, and more without forcing a complete reload.\nCSS Hot Reloading\nAs part of our asset system overhaul, we implemented hotreloading of CSS files in the asset directory. If a CSS file appears in your RSX, the\ndx\nCLI will watch that file and immediately stream its updates to the running app. This works for web, desktop, and fullstack, with mobile support coming in a future mobile-centric update.\nScreen_Recording_2024-03-20_at_6.30.47_AM.mov\nWhat’s even niftier is that you can stream these changes to several devices at once, unlocking simultaneous hotreloading across all devices that you target:\nHotreload_triple_-_HD_1080p.mov\n5x Faster Desktop Rendering\nDioxus implements several optimizations to make diffing rendering fast.\nTemplates\nlet dioxus skip diffing on any static parts of the rsx macro. However, diffing is only one side of the story. After you create a list of changes you need to make to the DOM, you need to apply them.\nWe developed\nsledgehammer\nfor dioxus web to make applying those mutations as fast as possible. It makes manipulating the DOM from Rust almost as\nfast as native JavaScript\n.\nIn dioxus 0.5, we apply that same technique to apply changes across the network as fast as possible. Instead of using json to communicate changes to the desktop and liveview renderers, dioxus 0.5 uses a binary protocol.\nFor render intensive workloads, the new renderer takes only 1/5 the time to apply the changes in the browser with 1/2 the latency. Here is one of the benchmarks we developed while working on the new binary protocol. In dioxus 0.4, the renderer was constantly freezing. In dioxus 0.5, it runs smoothly:\nDioxus 0.4\n284067659-2f44831d-bf2c-49f0-a494-3d2b37244e8c.mov\nDioxus 0.5\n284067647-c126e688-234a-4100-9c25-042b03f52d36.mov\nSpreading props\nOne common pattern when creating components is providing some additional functionality to a specific element. When you wrap an element, it is often useful to provide some control over what attributes are set in the final element. Instead of manually copying over each attribute from the element, dioxus 0.5 supports extending specific elements and spreading the attributes into an element:\n#\n[\nderive\n(\nProps\n,\nPartialEq\n,\nClone\n)\n]\nstruct\nProps\n{\n// You can extend a specific element or global attributes\n#\n[\nprops\n(\nextends = img\n)\n]\nattributes\n:\nVec\n<\nAttribute\n>\n,\n}\nfn\nImgPlus\n(\nprops\n:\nProps\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\n// You can spread those attributes into any element\nimg\n{\n..props\n.\nattributes\n}\n}\n}\nfn\napp\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nImgPlus\n{\n// You can use any attributes you would normally use on the img element\nwidth\n:\n\"10px\"\n,\nheight\n:\n\"10px\"\n,\nsrc\n:\n\"https://example.com/image.png\"\n,\n}\n}\n}\nShorthand attributes\nAnother huge quality-of-life feature we added was the ability to use shorthand struct initialization syntax to pass attributes into elements and components. We got tired of passing\nclass: class\neverywhere and decided to finally implement this long awaited feature, at the expense of some code breakage. Now, it’s super simple to declare attributes from props:\n#\n[\ncomponent\n]\nfn\nImgPlus\n(\nclass\n:\nString\n,\nid\n:\nString\n,\nsrc\n:\nString\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nimg\n{\nclass\n,\nid\n,\nsrc\n}\n}\n}\nThis feature works for anything implementing\nIntoAttribute\n, meaning signals also benefit from shorthand initialization. While signals as attributes don’t yet skip diffing, we plan to add this as a performance optimization throughout the 0.5 release cycle.\nMulti-line attribute merging\nAnother amazing feature added this cycle was attribute merging. When working with libraries like tailwind, you’ll occasionally want to make certain attributes conditional. Before, you had to format the attribute using an empty string. Now, you can simply add an extra attribute with a conditional, and the attribute will be merged using a space as a delimiter:\n#\n[\ncomponent\n]\nfn\nBlog\n(\nenabled\n:\nbool\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\ndiv\n{\nclass\n:\n\"bg-gray-200 border rounded shadow\"\n,\nclass\n:\nif\nenabled\n{\n\"text-white\"\n}\n}\n}\n}\nThis is particularly important when using libraries like tailwind where attributes need to be parsed at compile time but also dynamic at runtime. This syntax integrates with the tailwind compiler, removing the runtime overhead for libraries like tailwind-merge.\nServer function streaming\nDioxus 0.5 supports the latest version of\nthe server functions crate\nwhich supports streaming data. Server functions can now choose to stream data to or from the client. This makes it easier to do a whole class of tasks on the server.\nCreating a streaming server function is as easy as defining the output type and returning a TextStream from the server function. Streaming server functions are great for updating the client during any long running task.\nWe built an AI text generation example here:\nhttps://github.com/ealmloff/dioxus-streaming-llm\nthat uses Kalosm and local LLMS to serve what is essentially a clone of OpenAI’s ChatGPT endpoint on commodity hardware.\n#\n[\nserver\n(\noutput =\nStreamingText\n)\n]\npub\nasync\nfn\nmistral\n(\ntext\n:\nString\n)\n->\nResult\n<\nTextStream\n,\nServerFnError\n>\n{\nlet\ntext_generation_stream =\ntodo\n!\n(\n)\n;\nOk\n(\nTextStream\n::\nnew\n(\ntext_generation_stream\n)\n)\n}\nnative_drop.mov\nSide note, the AI metaframework used here -\nKalosm\n- is maintained by the Dioxus core team member ealmloff, and his AI GUI app Floneum is built with Dioxus!\nFullstack CLI platform\nThe CLI now supports a\nfullstack\nplatform with hot reloading and parallel builds for the client and sever. You can now serve your fullstack app with the\ndx\ncommand:\ndx serve\n#\nOr with an explicit platform\ndx serve --platform fullstack\nLiveview router support\n#1505\n@\nDonAlonzo\nadded liveview support for the router in dioxus 0.5. The router will now work out of the box with your liveview apps!\nCustom Asset Handlers\n#1719\n@willcrichton\nadded support for custom asset handlers to dioxus desktop. Custom asset handlers let you efficiently stream data from your rust code into the browser without going through javascript. This is great for high bandwidth communication like\nvideo streaming\n:\nScreen_Recording_2024-02-22_at_10.40.42_AM.mov\nNow, you can do things like work with gstreamer or webrtc and pipe data directly into the webview without needing to encode/decode frames by hand.\nNative File Handling\nThis is a bit smaller of a tweak, but now we properly support file drops for desktop:\nnative_drop.mov\nPreviously we just gave you the option to intercept filedrops but now it’s natively integrated into the event systme.\nError handling\nError handling: You can use error boundaries and the throw trait to easily handle errors higher up in your app\nDioxus provides a much easier way to handle errors: throwing them. Throwing errors combines the best parts of an error state and early return: you can easily throw an error with\n?\n, but you keep information about the error so that you can handle it in a parent component.\nYou can call\nthrow\non any\nResult\ntype that implements\nDebug\nto turn it into an error state and then use\n?\nto return early if you do hit an error. You can capture the error state with an\nErrorBoundary\ncomponent that will render the a different component if an error is thrown in any of its children.\nfn\nParent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nErrorBoundary\n{\nhandle_error\n:\n|error| rsx!\n{\n\"Oops, we encountered an error. Please report {error} to the developer of this application\"\n}\n,\nThrowsError\n{\n}\n}\n}\n}\nfn\nThrowsError\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nname\n:\ni32\n=\nuse_hook\n(\n||\n\"1.234\"\n)\n.\nparse\n(\n)\n.\nthrow\n(\n)\n?\n;\ntodo\n!\n(\n)\n}\nYou can even nest\nErrorBoundary\ncomponents to capture errors at different levels of your app.\nfn\nApp\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nErrorBoundary\n{\nhandle_error\n:\n|error| rsx!\n{\n\"Hmm, something went wrong. Please report {error} to the developer\"\n}\n,\nParent\n{\n}\n}\n}\n}\nfn\nParent\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nrsx\n!\n{\nErrorBoundary\n{\nhandle_error\n:\n|error| rsx!\n{\n\"The child component encountered an error: {error}\"\n}\n,\nThrowsError\n{\n}\n}\n}\n}\nfn\nThrowsError\n(\n)\n->\nElement\n{\nlet\nname\n:\ni32\n=\nuse_hook\n(\n||\n\"1.234\"\n)\n.\nparse\n(\n)\n.\nthrow\n(\n)\n?\n;\ntodo\n!\n(\n)\n}\nThis pattern is particularly helpful whenever your code generates a non-recoverable error. You can gracefully capture these \"global\" error states without panicking or handling state for each error yourself.\nHotreloading by default and “develop” mode for desktop\nWe shipped hotreloading in 0.3, added it to desktop in 0.4, and now we’re finally enabling it by default in 0.5. By default, when you\ndx serve\nyour app, hotreloading is enabled in development mode.\nAdditionally, we’ve drastically improved the developer experience of building desktop apps. When we can’t hotreload the app and have to do a full recompile, we now preserve the state of the open windows and resume that state. This means your app won’t block your entire screen on every edit and it will maintain its size and position, leading to a more magical experience. Once you’ve played with it, you can never go back - it’s that good.\nresume_state_small.mov\nUpdates to the dioxus template\nWith this update, our newest core team member Miles (lovingly,\n@doge\non our discord) put serious work into overhauling documentation and our templates. We now have templates to create new dioxus apps for web, desktop, mobile, tui, and fullstack under one command.\noh_five_release.mov\nWe also updated the default app you get when using\ndx new\nto be closer to the traditional create-react-app. The template is now seeded with assets, CSS, and some basic deploy configuration. Plus, it includes links to useful resources like dioxus-std, the VSCode Extension, docs, tutorials, and more.\nDioxus-Community and Dioxus-std\nThe Dioxus Community is something special: discord members marc and Doge have been hard at working updating important ecosystem crates for the 0.5 release. With this release, important crates like icons, charts, and the dioxus-specific standard library are ready to use right out the gate. The\nDioxus Community\nproject is a new GitHub organization that keeps important crates up-to-date even when the original maintainers step down. If you build a library for Dioxus, we’ll be happy to help maintain it, keeping it at what is essentially “Tier 2” support.\nComing soon\nAt a certain point we had to stop adding new features to this release. There’s plenty of cool projects on the horizon:\nStabilizing and more deeply integrating the asset system\nBundle splitting the outputted\n.wasm\ndirectly - with lazy components\nIslands and resumable interactivity (serializing signals!)\nServer components and merging LiveView into fullstack\nEnhanced Devtools (potentially featuring some AI!) and testing framework\nComplete mobile overhaul\nFullstack overhaul with websockets, SSE, progressive forms, and more\nSneak Peek: Dioxus-Blitz revival using Servo\nWe’re not going to say much about this now, but here’s a sneak peek at “Blitz 2.0”… we’re finally integrating servo into blitz so you can render natively with WGPU using the same CSS engine that powers Firefox. To push this effort forward, we’ve brought the extremely talented Nico Burns (the wizard behind our layout library Taffy) on full time. More about this later, but here’s a little demo of\ngoogle.com\nbeing rendered at 900 FPS entirely on the GPU:\nAdmittedly the current iteration is not quite there (google.com is in fact a little wonky) but we’re progressing rapidly here and are quickly approaching something quite usable. The repo is here if you want to take a look and get involved:\nhttps://github.com/jkelleyrtp/stylo-dioxus\nHow can you contribute?\nWell, that’s it for the new features. We might’ve missed a few things (there’s so much new!). If you find Dioxus as exciting as we do, we’d love your help to completely transform app development. We’d love contributions including:\nTranslating docs into your native language\nAttempting “Good First Issues”\nImproving our documentation\nContributing to the CLI\nHelp answer questions from the discord community\nThat’s it! We’re super grateful for the community support and excited for the rest of 2024.\nBuild cool things! ✌️\nFull Changelog (since 0.4.3)\nAdd into attribute value impl for String
