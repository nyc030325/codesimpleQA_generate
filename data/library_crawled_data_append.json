    "content": "Swift 6.1 is now available! This release includes new language enhancements to improve productivity, diagnostics improvements, package traits, and ongoing work to improve data-race safety usability and compile times. Read on for an overview of the changes to the language, package manager, and next steps for getting started with Swift 6.1. Language and Standard Library Concurrency Swift’s concurrency model allows writing nonisolated on properties and functions to indicate that an API is safe to call from any concurrent context. Swift 6.1 extends nonisolated to types and extensions. This allows you to write nonisolated to prevent @MainActor inference on a type, or to apply nonisolated to all methods in an extension without having to annotate every method: @MainActor struct S { let id: Int let name: String // mutable state and MainActor methods } nonisolated extension S: CustomStringConvertible, Equatable { var description: String { \"id: \\(id), name: \\(name)\" } static func ==(lhs: S, rhs: S) -> Bool { lhs.id == rhs.id } } Swift 6.1 also improves type inference for task groups by inferring the child task result type of withTaskGroup and withThrowingTaskGroup. Previously, you always had to write the child task result type as an argument when creating the task group: let messages = await withTaskGroup(of: Message.self) { group in for id in ids { group.addTask { await downloadMessage(for: id) } } var messages: [Message] = [] for await message in group { messages.append(message) } return messages } In Swift 6.1, the child task result type can be inferred from the task group closure: // No need for `(of: Message.self)` like before. let messages = await withTaskGroup { group in for id in ids { group.addTask { await downloadMessage(for: id) } } var messages: [Message] = [] for await message in group { messages.append(message) } return messages } The approachability of data-race safety remains an area of active development; you can find an overview of the approach in the vision document for improving the approachability of data-race safety. Many Swift Evolution proposals implementing the features described in the vision document are under active review, and your feedback will help shape these improvements. Implementing Objective-C types in Swift Swift 6.1 includes a new attribute, @implementation, which can be used together with @objc to provide an implementation for a declaration that has been imported from Objective-C. You can write @objc @implementation on a Swift extension to replace an Objective-C @implementation block. You write headers as normal for an Objective-C class, but instead of writing an @implementation in an Objective-C file, you write an @objc @implementation extension in a Swift file. You can even port an existing class’s implementation to Swift one category at a time without breaking backwards compatibility. Productivity enhancements Swift allows including trailing commas in collection literals to make it easy to append, remove, reorder, or comment out the last element as any other element: let rank = [ \"Player 1\", \"Player 3\", \"Player 2\", ] Swift 6.1 extends trailing comma support to tuples, parameter and argument lists, generic parameter lists, closure capture lists, and string interpolations: let numbers = [1, 2, 0, 3, 4, 0, 0, 5] let subsequences = numbers.split( separator: 0, maxSplits: 1, ) In addition to improved development ergonomics, code generation tools like plugins and macros can be simplified, because generating a comma-separated list no longer needs a special condition for the last element. You can find a complete list of language proposals that were accepted through the Swift Evolution process and implemented in Swift 6 on the Swift Evolution dashboard. Package and build improvements Swift 6.1 introduces package traits, a new configuration for packages that allows them to offer different APIs and features when used in specific environments, such as Embedded Swift and WebAssembly. Package authors can define a set of traits in their Package.swift that their package offers, which provide a way to express conditional compilation and optional dependencies. The package can specify a set of default traits that are enabled in clients, and clients can customize the traits they use when they declare the dependency: dependencies: [ .package( url: \"https://github.com/Org/SomePackage.git\", from: \"1.0.0\", traits: [ .default, // enable all of the package's default traits \"Embedded\" ] ), ] Many editing features, such as jump to definition for APIs in libraries you’re using, are powered by indexing. Before Swift 6.1, indexing occurred when you built your project, which meant that any additions or changes to the library were only surfaced by those editing features after you perform a build. Swift 6.1 enables background indexing by default for SwiftPM projects in SourceKit-LSP. Cross-module and global functionality stays updated as you make changes to your project. Swift Testing Swift 6.1 enables custom Swift Testing traits to perform logic before or after tests run in order to share set-up or tear-down logic. If you write a custom trait type which conforms to the new TestScoping protocol, you can implement a method to customize the scope in which each test or suite the trait is applied to will execute. For example, you could implement a trait which binds a task local value to a mocked resource: struct MockAPICredentialsTrait: TestTrait, TestScoping { func provideScope(for test: Test, testCase: Test.Case?, performing function: @Sendable () async throws -> Void) async throws { let mockCredentials = APICredentials(apiKey: \"fake\") try await APICredentials.$current.withValue(mockCredentials) { try await function() } } } extension Trait where Self == MockAPICredentialsTrait { static var mockAPICredentials: Self { Self() } } @Test(.mockAPICredentials) func example() { // Validate API usage, referencing `APICredentials.current`... } For more details, see ST-0007: Test Scoping Traits. Swift Testing in Swift 6.1 also includes refined versions of the #expect(throws:) and #require(throws:) macros which return their caught errors, making inspecting them in test functions more ergonomic (ST-0006). Swift-DocC Swift-DocC introduces a more human readable and human writable alternative for symbol link disambiguation based on parameter type and return type information. For example, consider these three function overloads with different parameter types and return types: func doSomething(first: String, second: Int) -> Double func doSomething(first: String?, second: Int) -> Float func doSomething(first: String?, second: Int) -> Double Previously, if you wrote a link to one of these overloads you needed to include a short hash of that symbol’s unique identifier to disambiguate the link and uniquely reference the specific overload. Swift-DocC’s warnings aided in writing these hashes but a person can’t decode the resulting hash suffix (-3c5j) to determine which overload the link is referring to. Now, you can use a combination of parameter types and return types—like -(String,_), ->Float, or -(String?,_)->Double—to disambiguate the link and uniquely reference a specific overload. You can discover the minimal combination of parameter types and return types for each overload from Swift-DocC’s warnings about ambiguous symbol links. For more details, see the Ambiguous Symbol Links section of Linking to Symbols and Other Content. Install Swift 6.1 You can try out these exciting new developments in Swift 6.1 today! If you’re building apps for Apple platforms, Swift 6.1 is included in Xcode 16.3, now available from the App Store. And the easiest way to install the standalone Swift 6.1 toolchain is using swiftly, the new Swift version manager that runs on macOS and Linux. Additional installation methods, including for Windows, are included on the Install Swift page.",

    "release_date": "2024-03-05T10:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Swift was designed to be safe by default, preventing entire categories of programming mistakes at compile time. Sources of undefined behavior in C-based languages, such as using variables before they’re initialized or a use-after-free, are defined away in Swift. An increasingly important source of undefined behavior is concurrent code that inadvertently accesses memory from one thread at the same time that another thread is writing to the same memory. This kind of unsafety is called a data race, and data races make concurrent programs exceptionally difficult to write correctly. Swift solves this problem through data isolation provided by actors and tasks, which guarantees mutually exclusive access to shared mutable state. Data isolation enforcement has been under active development since 2020 when the Swift concurrency roadmap was posted. Swift 5.10 accomplishes full data isolation in the concurrency language model. This important milestone has taken years of active development over many releases. The concurrency model was introduced in Swift 5.5 including async/await, actors, and structured concurrency. Swift 5.7 introduced Sendable as the fundamental concept for thread-safe types whose values can be shared across arbitrary concurrent contexts without introducing a risk of data races. And now, in Swift 5.10, full data isolation is enforced at compile time in all areas of the language when the complete concurrency checking option is enabled. Full data isolation in Swift 5.10 sets the stage for the next major release, Swift 6. The Swift 6.0 compiler will offer a new, opt-in Swift 6 language mode that will enforce full data isolation by default, and we will embark upon the transition to eliminate data races across all software written in Swift. Swift 5.10 will produce data-race warnings in some circumstances where the code could be proven safe with additional compiler analysis. A major focus of language development for the Swift 6 release is improving the usability of strict concurrency checking by mitigating false positive concurrency errors in common code patterns that are proven to be safe. Read on to learn about full data isolation in Swift 5.10, new unsafe opt-outs for actor isolation checking, and the remaining concurrency evolution ahead of Swift 6. Data-race safety in Swift 5.10 Full data isolation Swift 5.10 rounds out the data-race safety semantics in all corners of the language, and fixes numerous bugs in Sendable and actor isolation checking to strengthen the guarantees of complete concurrency checking. When building code with the compiler flag -strict-concurrency=complete, Swift 5.10 will diagnose the potential for data races at compile time except where an explicit unsafe opt-out, such as nonisolated(unsafe) or @unchecked Sendable, is used. For example, in Swift 5.9, the following code fails an isolation assertion at runtime due to a @MainActor-isolated initializer being evaluated outside the actor, but it was not diagnosed under -strict-concurrency=complete: @MainActor class MyModel { private init() { MainActor.assertIsolated() } static let shared = MyModel() } func useShared() async { let model = MyModel.shared } await useShared() The above code admits data races. MyModel.shared is a @MainActor-isolated static variable, which evaluates a @MainActor-isolated initial value upon first access. MyModel.shared is accessed synchronously from a nonisolated context inside the useShared() function, so the initial value is computed off the main actor. In Swift 5.10, compiling the code with -strict-concurrency=complete produces a warning that the access must be done asynchronously: warning: expression is 'async' but is not marked with 'await' let model = MyModel.shared ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~ await The possible fixes for resolving the data race are 1) access MyModel.shared asynchronously using await, 2) make MyModel.init and MyModel.shared both nonisolated and move the code that requires the main actor into a separate isolated method, or 3) isolate useShared() to @MainActor. You can find more details about the changes and additions to the full data isolation programming model in the Swift 5.10 release notes. Unsafe opt-outs Unsafe opt-outs, such as @unchecked Sendable conformances, are important for communicating that code is safe from data-races when it cannot be proven automatically by the compiler. These tools are necessary in cases where synchronization is implemented in a way that the compiler cannot reason about, such as through OS-specific primitives or when working with thread-safe types implemented in C/C++/Objective-C. However, @unchecked Sendable conformances are difficult to use correctly, because they opt the entire type out of data-race safety checking. In many cases, only one specific property in a type needs the opt-out, while the rest of the implementation adheres to static concurrency safety. Swift 5.10 introduces a new nonisolated(unsafe) keyword to opt out of actor isolation checking for stored properties and variables. nonisolated(unsafe) can be used on any form of storage, including stored properties, local variables, and global/static variables. For example, global and static variables can be accessed from anywhere in your code, so they are required to either be immutable and Sendable, or isolated to a global actor: import Dispatch struct MyData { static let cacheQueue = DispatchQueue(...) // All access to 'globalCache' is guarded by 'cacheQueue' static var globalCache: [MyData] = [] } When building the above code with -strict-concurrency=complete, the compiler emits a warning: warning: static property 'globalCache' is not concurrency-safe because it is non-isolated global shared mutable state static var globalCache: [MyData] = [] ^ note: isolate 'globalCache' to a global actor, or convert it to a 'let' constant and conform it to 'Sendable' All uses of globalCache are guarded by cacheQueue.async { ... }, so this code is free of data races in practice. In this case, nonisolated(unsafe) can be applied to the static variable to silence the concurrency warning: import Dispatch struct MyData { static let cacheQueue = DispatchQueue(...) // All access to 'globalCache' is guarded by 'cacheQueue' nonisolated(unsafe) static var globalCache: [MyData] = [] } nonisolated(unsafe) also eliminates the need for @unchecked Sendable wrapper types that are used only to pass specific instances of non-Sendable values across isolation boundaries when there is no potential for concurrent access: // 'MutableData' is not 'Sendable' class MutableData { ... } func processData(_: MutableData) async { ... } @MainActor func send() async { nonisolated(unsafe) let data = MutableData() await processData(data) } Note that without correct implementation of a synchronization mechanism to achieve data isolation, dynamic analysis from exclusivity enforcement or tools such as the Thread Sanitizer may still identify failures. Language evolution ahead of Swift 6 The next release of Swift will be Swift 6. The complete concurrency model in Swift 5.10 is overly restrictive, and several Swift Evolution proposals are in active development to improve the usability of full data isolation by removing false postive data-race errors. This work includes lifting limitations on passing non-Sendable values across isolation boundaries when the compiler determines there is no potential for concurrent access, more effective Sendable inference for functions and key-paths, and more. You can find the set of proposals that will round out Swift 6 at Swift.org/swift-evolution. Next Steps Try out complete concurrency checking You can help shape the transition to the Swift 6 language mode by trying out complete concurrency checking in your project and providing feedback on your experience. If you find any remaining compiler bugs where complete concurrency checking does not diagnose a data race at compile time, please report an issue. You can also provide feedback that helps improve the concurrency documentation, compiler error messages, and the upcoming Swift 6 migration guide. If you encounter a case where the compiler diagnoses a data-race warning that you don’t understand or you’re not sure how to resolve a given data-race warning, please start a discussion thread on the Swift forums using the concurrency tag.

    "title": "\n       Swift 5.9 Released | Swift.org \n    ",
    "release_date": "2023-09-18T07:00:00-04:00",
    "content": "Swift 5.9 is now available! 🎉 This is a major new release that adds an expressive macro system to the language and introduces support for integrating Swift into C++ codebases through bidirectional interoperability. It also introduces parameter packs, an improved expression evaluator while debugging, enhanced crash handling, Windows platform improvements, and more. Read on for a deep dive into changes to the language, standard library, tooling, platform support, and next steps for getting started with Swift 5.9. Thank you to everyone in the Swift community who made this release possible. Your Swift Forums discussions, bug reports, pull requests, educational content, and other contributions are always appreciated! Language and Standard Library Swift’s fundamental goal is to encourage code that is clear and concise, while remaining safe and efficient. This release adds three long-desired features that further that goal: a new macro system for more expressive libraries, parameter packs to make overloaded APIs natural to use, and new ownership features to offer more control over performance in low-level code. Macros Macros help developers reduce repetitive boilerplate and create more expressive libraries that can be distributed as a Swift package. Using a macro is easy and natural. Macros can either be expanded with a function-like freestanding #macroName syntax: let _: Font = #fontLiteral(name: \"SF Mono\", size: 14, weight: .regular) or attached to declarations with an @MacroName attribute: // Move storage from the stored properties into a dictionary, // turning the stored properties into computed properties. @DictionaryStorage struct Point { var x: Int = 1 var y: Int = 2 } They work just like built-in language features but can’t be mistaken for normal code. You write macros using a powerful and flexible approach: they are simply Swift functions that use the SwiftSyntax library to generate code to be inserted into the source file. Macros make it easy for your library’s users to adopt powerful capabilities that adapt to the code they’re used in, like the new Observation module, which allows Swift classes to automatically notify other code when their properties change. The Swift community has been hard at work creating tools and frameworks that build upon macros. For some examples, take a look at swift-power-assert, swift-spyable, swift-macro-testing, and MetaCodable. Swift 5.9 supports macros on macOS and Linux, with Windows support coming soon. Parameter packs Parameter packs let you write generic types and functions which work over an arbitrary number of types. For example, without parameter packs, if you wanted to write a function called all to check whether any number of Optional values are nil, you would need to write a separate overload for each argument length you wanted to support, creating an arbitrary upper limit: func all<W1>(_ optional: W1?) -> W1? func all<W1, W2>(_ optional1: W1?, optional2: W2?) -> (W1, W2)? func all<W1, W2, W3>(_ optional1: W1?, optional2: W2?, optional3: W3?) -> (W1, W2, W3)? With parameter packs, you can express this API as a single function that has no upper limit, allowing you to pass any number of arguments: func all<each Wrapped>(_ optional: repeat (each Wrapped)?) -> (repeat each Wrapped)? Calling an API that uses parameter packs is intuitive and requires no extra work: if let (int, double, string, bool) = all(optionalInt, optionalDouble, optionalString, optionalBool) { print(int, double, string, bool) } else { print(\"got a nil\") } Ownership Ownership features can help developers fine-tune memory management behavior in performance-critical code. The new consume operator tells Swift to deinitialize a variable and transfer its contents without copying it. The consuming and borrowing parameter modifiers provide hints that Swift can use to eliminate unnecessary copying and reference-counting operations when passing a parameter. Finally, noncopyable structs and enums allow you to create types which, like a class, can’t be meaningfully copied when assigned, but like a struct or enum, do not need to be reference-counted because only one storage location can own the instance at a time. These major features are the foundation for further evolution that puts more expressive power and performance control into your hands. We’re excited about what you can do with Swift 5.9, and we’re working toward a future with a larger suite of variadic generics and ownership features. Additional Features Swift 5.9 also includes smaller, quality-of-life changes to the language, like the ability to use if and switch as expressions for variable assignment and return values: statusBar.text = if !hasConnection { \"Disconnected\" } else if let error = lastError { error.localizedDescription } else { \"Ready\" } A new package access level lets other modules in the same package access APIs, but hides them from code outside the package. It’s great for splitting up large modules into several smaller ones without exposing internals to the package’s clients. Developers using Swift Concurrency may appreciate the more convenient DiscardingTaskGroup types for task groups that don’t generate results and the advanced custom actor executors feature for controlling the exact environment that an actor is run in. A full list of Swift 5.9 Evolution proposals can be found at the end of this post. Developer Experience Crash Handling On Linux, the Swift runtime will now catch program crashes and Swift runtime errors and display a backtrace on the program’s output. The backtracer is out-of-process and includes support for async functions. This feature is also available on macOS but is disabled by default. To enable it, set SWIFT_BACKTRACE=enable=yes and sign your program with the com.apple.security.get-task-allow entitlement. Debugging Swift 5.9 introduces new features to LLDB and the Swift compiler aimed at making Swift debugging faster and more reliable. The p and po commands now print local variables and properties as fast as the frame variable or v commands by bypassing the Swift compiler when evaluating simple expressions. Swift expressions can now refer to generic type parameters. This allows setting a conditional breakpoint in a generic function that only triggers when a type parameter is instantiated with a specific concrete type. The debug info produced by the Swift compiler now more precisely scopes local variables, making it less likely to display variables backed by uninitialized memory in the debugger. Ecosystem C++ Interoperability Swift 5.9 supports bidirectional interoperability with C++ and Objective-C++ for certain kinds of APIs. For example, if you have a C++ function like: // Clang module 'PromptResponder' #pragma once #include <vector> std::vector<std::string> generatePromptResponse(std::string prompt); you can call it directly from your Swift code: import PromptResponder let codeLines = generatePromptResponse(\"Write Swift code that prints hello world\") .map(String.init) .filter { !$0.isEmpty } for line in codeLines { print(line) } C++ interoperability is actively evolving, with some aspects subject to change in future releases as the community gathers feedback from real world adoption in mixed Swift and C++ codebases. For information on enabling C++ interoperability and the supported language subset, please refer to the documentation. Special thanks to the C++ Interoperability Workgroup for their focus and dedication in supporting this feature. Swift Package Manager The Swift Package Manager has a number of improvements in Swift 5.9: Packages can use the new package access modifier, allowing access of symbols in another target / module within the same package without making them public. SwiftPM automatically sets the new compiler configuration to ensure this feature works out-of-the-box for packages. The CompilerPluginSupport module enables defining macro targets. Macro targets allow authoring and distributing custom Swift macros as APIs in a library. The new .embedInCode resource rule allows embedding the contents of a resource into an executable by generating a byte array. The allowNetworkConnections(scope:reason:) setting gives a command plugin permissions to access the network. Permissions can be scoped to Unix domain sockets as well as local or remote IP connections, with an option to limit by port. For non-interactive use cases, the --allow-network-connections command-line flag allows network connections for a particular scope. SwiftPM can now publish to a registry following the specification defined in SE-0391, as well as support signed packages, which may be required by a registry. Trust-on-first-use (TOFU) validation checks can now use signing identities in addition to fingerprints, and are enforced for source archives as well as package manifests. SwiftPM now supports cross compilation based on the Swift SDK bundle format. While the feature is still considered experimental, we invite users to try it out and provide feedback. See the Swift Package Manager changelog for the complete list of changes. Swift Syntax swift-syntax is an essential tool for parsing Swift code and helps power the new macro system. This year, swift-syntax received a number of improvements: Syntax node names are more consistent and accurately reflect the Swift language. Error recovery in the new SwiftParser is greatly improved, leading to more precise error messages for incorrect or missing syntax. Incremental parsing is now supported, allowing editors and other tools to only reparse those parts of a syntax tree that have changed. The documentation of swift-syntax has been greatly expanded. Over the last year, swift-syntax has been a huge success as an open source project. Since the release of Swift 5.8, more than 30 distinct contributors have worked on the package, accounting for more than 30% of the commits. In addition, the community tool swift-ast-explorer.com is invaluable in exploring and understanding the SwiftSyntax tree. Thank you to everyone who contributed! Server Custom actor executors and other features from Swift 5.9 are making their way into the Swift on server ecosystem. The server workgroup also recently published their annual update for 2023, detailing plans to increase adoption of concurrency within key libraries, as well as other efforts. Windows Platform Windows support for Swift 5.9 greatly improves stability and the developer experience. The Windows installer now supports installation both before and after Visual Studio installation, and no longer requires repair after a Visual Studio upgrade. Initial work has also begun to enable multiple, parallel toolchains installed side-by-side on Windows. The Swift toolchain also added new flags (-windows-sdk-root, -windows-sdk-version, -visualc-tools-root, -visualc-tools-version) to help control the Windows SDK and Visual C++ tools that it builds against. The Windows SDK (WinSDK) module saw improvements in coverage, enabling access to a wider set of system APIs. The Visual C++ (vcruntime) module was greatly restructured to support C++ interoperability. Structured Concurrency is now significantly more stable on Windows, eliminating stack overflows and other execution failures for common patterns such as iterating over an AsyncStream with many elements. Improvements to path handling in the LSP and SwiftPM makes both of these tools more robust on Windows. LLDB also saw initial work towards improving support for Windows, enabling fundamental debugging workflows in LLDB on Windows. While still a work in progress, this will significantly improve the developer experience on Windows. Small improvements have also been made to reduce the size of the toolchain on Windows. Next Steps Downloads Official binaries are available for download from Swift.org for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The Swift 5.9 compiler is also included in Xcode 15. Website Swift.org has revamped certain key pages, including a richer home page and clearer download and install instructions.

However, when this is done for pre-existing\npublic\nmethods that are\nnot\nasync\n, the result is source incompatibility for some users, as mutable values captured by such closures will cause unexpected build errors. The correct way to suppress this behavior is to mark such methods with the\n@preconcurrency\nattribute, signaling to the compiler that users may not yet expect the additional restrictions of\n@Sendable\nto apply without sacrificing correctness for Concurrency-ready code. Unfortunately, Vapor recently added\n@Sendable\nannotations to many of its APIs without also adding the\n@preconcurrency\nannotation; this update addresses that oversight.\nThis patch was released by\n@gwynne\nFull Changelog\n:\n4.84.0...4.84.1",

Please test your application thoroughly when upgrading to this release.\nAdded: Store now conforms to the\nObservableObject\n(\n#3625\n). This conformance does not provide any observation via\n@ObservedObject\n, and is provided as a convenience to allow stores to be held in\n@StateObject\ns. Store observation should continue to be done via the Observation framework (or Perception package) and the\n@ObservableState\nmacro.\nFixed: Store internals have been rewritten for performance and better memory management (\n#3460\n; thanks\n@arnauddorgans\n,\n#3638\n).\nFixed: swift-syntax 6.1 support (thanks\n@shimastripe\n,\n#3639\n).\nFixed: Don't allow actions to be sent to invalidated scoped stores in release (thanks\n@lukeredpath\n,\n#3640\n).\nInfrastructure: Update demo apps to declare store as static to avoid interference with Xcode previews (thanks\n@meltsplit\n,\n#3618\n).\nInfrastructure: Fix broken article link (thanks\n@bradhowes\n,\n#3626\n).\nInfrastructure: Improve Performance article (thanks\n@arnauddorgans\n,\n#3631\n).\nInfrastructure: Utilize\nswift-navigation\ninternally for presenting alerts and action sheets (thanks\n@juliensagot\n,\n#3623\n)\nInfrastructure: CI Improvements to minimize flakiness of GitHub actions (\n#3641\n).\nNew Contributors\n@bradhowes\nmade their first contribution in\n#3626\n@arnauddorgans\nmade their first contribution in\n#3631\n@shimastripe\nmade their first contribution in\n#3639\nFull Changelog\n:\n1.18.0...1.19.0",

(\n#594\n)\nFixes\nThe titles for nested option groups are preserved when embedded into commands without specifying a new title. (\n#592\n)\nWhen wrapping help and error messages, the library now uses the\nCOLUMNS\nenvironment variable when set, instead of immediately falling back to 80 columns. (\n#596\n)\nBash completion scripts now respect the extensions given in a\n.file(...)\ncompletion kind. (\n#590\n)\nBash completion scripts now properly escape command names that include hyphens.

    "content": "What's Changed\nAdded:\nInline\nSnapshot Testing (\n#764\n). This allows your text-based snapshots to live right in the test source code, rather than in an external file:\nWhile the library has had experimental support for this feature since\n1.5.0\nthanks to\n@rjchatfield\n(\n#199\n), we've finally put the finishing touches to it:\nInline snapshot testing is available in a separate\nInlineSnapshotTesting\nmodule. To use inline snapshot testing, add a dependency on this module and update your existing imports:\n-\nimport SnapshotTesting\n+\nimport InlineSnapshotTesting\nThe feature has been rewritten to use\nSwiftSyntax\n. While a heavyweight dependency, it is a more reasonable tool for generating Swift code than string substitution, and will be an increasingly common dependency as the de facto tool for writing Swift macros.\nThe main\nSnapshotTesting\nmodule does not depend on SwiftSyntax, so existing snapshot tests will not incur cost of compiling SwiftSyntax.\nThe API now follows the same structure as\nassertSnapshot\n, except it uses a trailing closure to capture the inline snapshot. This makes it easy to update an existing snapshot test to use inline snapshots:\n-\nassertSnapshot(of: user, as: .json)\n+\nassertInlineSnapshot(of: user, as .json)\nAfter this assertion runs, the test source code is updated in place:\nassertInlineSnapshot\n(\nof\n:\nuser\n,\nas\n:\n.\njson\n)\n{\n\"\"\"\n{\n\"\nid\n\"\n: 42,\n\"\nisAdmin\n\"\n: true,\n\"\nname\n\"\n:\n\"\nBlob\n\"\n}\n\"\"\"\n}\nThese trailing closures are easy to select in Xcode in order to delete and re-record a snapshot: simply double-click one of the braces to highlight the closure, delete, and run the test.\nInline snapshotting's\nassertInlineSnapshot\ntesting tool is fully customizable so that you can build your own testing helpers on top of it without your users even knowing they are using snapshot testing. In fact, we do this to create a testing tool that helps us test the Swift code that powers\nPoint-Free\n. It's called\nassertRequest\n, and it allows you to simultaneously assert the request being made to the server (including URL, query parameters, headers, POST body) as well as the response from the server (including status code and headers).\nFor example, to test that when a request is made for a user to join a team subscription, we can\nwrite the following\n:\nawait\nassertRequest\n(\nconnection\n(\nfrom\n:\nrequest\n(\nto\n:\n.\nteamInviteCode\n(\n.\njoin\n(\ncode\n:\nsubscription\n.\nteamInviteCode\n,\nemail\n:\nnil\n)\n)\n,\nsession\n:\n.\nloggedIn\n(\nas\n:\ncurrentUser\n)\n)\n)\n)\nAnd when we first run the test it will automatically\nexpand\n:\nawait\nassertRequest\n(\nconnection\n(\nfrom\n:\nrequest\n(\nto\n:\n.\nteamInviteCode\n(\n.\njoin\n(\ncode\n:\nsubscription\n.\nteamInviteCode\n,\nemail\n:\nnil\n)\n)\n,\nsession\n:\n.\nloggedIn\n(\nas\n:\ncurrentUser\n)\n)\n)\n)\n{\n\"\"\"\nPOST http://localhost:8080/join/subscriptions-team_invite_code3\nCookie: pf_session={\n\"\nuserId\n\"\n:\n\"\n00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\n\"\n}\n\"\"\"\n}\nresponse\n:\n{\n\"\"\"\n302 Found\nLocation: /account\nReferrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin\nSet-Cookie: pf_session={\n\"\nflash\n\"\n:{\n\"\nmessage\n\"\n:\n\"\nYou now have access to Point-Free!\n\"\n,\n\"\npriority\n\"\n:\n\"\nnotice\n\"\n},\n\"\nuserId\n\"\n:\n\"\n00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\n\"\n}; Expires=Sat, 29 Jan 2028 00:00:00 GMT; Path=/\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nX-Download-Options: noopen\nX-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN\nX-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none\nX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block\n\"\"\"\n}\nThis shows that the response redirects the use back to their account page and shows them the flash message that they now have full access to Point-Free. This makes writing complex and nuanced tests incredibly easy, and so there is no reason to not write lots of tests for all the subtle edge cases of your application's logic.\nAdded: DocC documentation (\n#765\n). The\nSnapshotTesting\nand\nInlineSnapshotTesting\nare fully documented using DocC.\nInfrastructure: swift-format support (\n#765\n). The library is now auto-formatted using swift-format.\nFull Changelog\n:\n1.12.0...0.13.0",
