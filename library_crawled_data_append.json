    "content": "NumPy 1.25.0 Release Notes\nThe NumPy 1.25.0 release continues the ongoing work to improve the\nhandling and promotion of dtypes, increase the execution speed, and\nclarify the documentation. There has also been work to prepare for the\nfuture NumPy 2.0.0 release, resulting in a large number of new and\nexpired deprecation. Highlights are:\nSupport for MUSL, there are now MUSL wheels.\nSupport the Fujitsu C/C++ compiler.\nObject arrays are now supported in einsum\nSupport for inplace matrix multiplication (\n@=\n).\nWe will be releasing a NumPy 1.26 when Python 3.12 comes out. That is\nneeded because distutils has been dropped by Python 3.12 and we will be\nswitching to using meson for future builds. The next mainline release\nwill be NumPy 2.0.0. We plan that the 2.0 series will still support\ndownstream projects built against earlier versions of NumPy.\nThe Python versions supported in this release are 3.9-3.11.\nDeprecations\nnp.core.MachAr\nis deprecated. It is private API. In names defined\nin\nnp.core\nshould generally be considered private.\n(\ngh-22638\n)\nnp.finfo(None)\nis deprecated.\n(\ngh-23011\n)\nnp.round_\nis deprecated. Use\nnp.round\ninstead.\n(\ngh-23302\n)\nnp.product\nis deprecated. Use\nnp.prod\ninstead.\n(\ngh-23314\n)\nnp.cumproduct\nis deprecated. Use\nnp.cumprod\ninstead.\n(\ngh-23314\n)\nnp.sometrue\nis deprecated. Use\nnp.any\ninstead.\n(\ngh-23314\n)\nnp.alltrue\nis deprecated. Use\nnp.all\ninstead.\n(\ngh-23314\n)\nOnly ndim-0 arrays are treated as scalars. NumPy used to treat all\narrays of size 1 (e.g.,\nnp.array([3.14])\n) as scalars. In the\nfuture, this will be limited to arrays of ndim 0 (e.g.,\nnp.array(3.14)\n). The following expressions will report a\ndeprecation warning:\na\n=\nnp\n.\narray\n([\n3.14\n])\nfloat\n(\na\n)\n# better: a[0] to get the numpy.float or a.item()\nb\n=\nnp\n.\narray\n([[\n3.14\n]])\nc\n=\nnumpy\n.\nrandom\n.\nrand\n(\n10\n)\nc\n[\n0\n]\n=\nb\n# better: c[0] = b[0, 0]\n(\ngh-10615\n)\nnumpy.find_common_type\nis now deprecated and its use\nshould be replaced with either\nnumpy.result_type\nor\nnumpy.promote_types\n. Most users leave the second\nscalar_types\nargument to\nfind_common_type\nas\n[]\nin which case\nnp.result_type\nand\nnp.promote_types\nare both faster and more\nrobust. When not using\nscalar_types\nthe main difference is that\nthe replacement intentionally converts non-native byte-order to\nnative byte order. Further,\nfind_common_type\nreturns\nobject\ndtype rather than failing promotion. This leads to differences when\nthe inputs are not all numeric. Importantly, this also happens for\ne.g. timedelta/datetime for which NumPy promotion rules are\ncurrently sometimes surprising.\nWhen the\nscalar_types\nargument is not\n[]\nthings are more\ncomplicated. In most cases, using\nnp.result_type\nand passing the\nPython values\n0\n,\n0.0\n, or\n0j\nhas the same result as using\nint\n,\nfloat\n, or\ncomplex\nin\nscalar_types\n.\nWhen\nscalar_types\nis constructed,\nnp.result_type\nis the correct\nreplacement and it may be passed scalar values like\nnp.float32(0.0)\n. Passing values other than 0, may lead to\nvalue-inspecting behavior (which\nnp.find_common_type\nnever used\nand NEP 50 may change in the future). The main possible change in\nbehavior in this case, is when the array types are signed integers\nand scalar types are unsigned.\nIf you are unsure about how to replace a use of\nscalar_types\nor\nwhen non-numeric dtypes are likely, please do not hesitate to open a\nNumPy issue to ask for help.\n(\ngh-22539\n)\nExpired deprecations\nnp.core.machar\nand\nnp.finfo.machar\nhave been removed.\n(\ngh-22638\n)\n+arr\nwill now raise an error when the dtype is not numeric (and\npositive is undefined).\n(\ngh-22998\n)\nA sequence must now be passed into the stacking family of functions\n(\nstack\n,\nvstack\n,\nhstack\n,\ndstack\nand\ncolumn_stack\n).\n(\ngh-23019\n)\nnp.clip\nnow defaults to same-kind casting. Falling back to unsafe\ncasting was deprecated in NumPy 1.17.\n(\ngh-23403\n)\nnp.clip\nwill now propagate\nnp.nan\nvalues passed as\nmin\nor\nmax\n. Previously, a scalar NaN was usually ignored. This was\ndeprecated in NumPy 1.17.\n(\ngh-23403\n)\nThe\nnp.dual\nsubmodule has been removed.\n(\ngh-23480\n)\nNumPy now always ignores sequence behavior for an array-like\n(defining one of the array protocols). (Deprecation started NumPy\n1.20)\n(\ngh-23660\n)\nThe niche\nFutureWarning\nwhen casting to a subarray dtype in\nastype\nor the array creation functions such as\nasarray\nis now\nfinalized. The behavior is now always the same as if the subarray\ndtype was wrapped into a single field (which was the workaround,\npreviously). (FutureWarning since NumPy 1.20)\n(\ngh-23666\n)\n==\nand\n!=\nwarnings have been finalized. The\n==\nand\n!=\noperators on arrays now always:\nraise errors that occur during comparisons such as when the\narrays have incompatible shapes\n(\nnp.array([1, 2]) == np.array([1, 2, 3])\n).\nreturn an array of all\nTrue\nor all\nFalse\nwhen values are\nfundamentally not comparable (e.g. have different dtypes). An\nexample is\nnp.array([\"a\"]) == np.array([1])\n.\nThis mimics the Python behavior of returning\nFalse\nand\nTrue\nwhen comparing incompatible types like\n\"a\" == 1\nand\n\"a\" != 1\n. For a long time these gave\nDeprecationWarning\nor\nFutureWarning\n.\n(\ngh-22707\n)\nNose support has been removed. NumPy switched to using pytest in\n2018 and nose has been unmaintained for many years. We have kept\nNumPy's nose support to avoid breaking downstream projects who\nmight have been using it and not yet switched to pytest or some\nother testing framework. With the arrival of Python 3.12, unpatched\nnose will raise an error. It is time to move on.\nDecorators removed\n:\nraises\nslow\nsetastest\nskipif\nknownfailif\ndeprecated\nparametrize\n_needs_refcount\nThese are not to be confused with pytest versions with similar\nnames, e.g., pytest.mark.slow, pytest.mark.skipif,\npytest.mark.parametrize.\nFunctions removed\n:\nTester\nimport_nose\nrun_module_suite\n(\ngh-23041\n)\nThe\nnumpy.testing.utils\nshim has been removed. Importing from the\nnumpy.testing.utils\nshim has been deprecated since 2019, the shim\nhas now been removed. All imports should be made directly from\nnumpy.testing\n.\n(\ngh-23060\n)\nThe environment variable to disable dispatching has been removed.\nSupport for the\nNUMPY_EXPERIMENTAL_ARRAY_FUNCTION\nenvironment\nvariable has been removed. This variable disabled dispatching with\n__array_function__\n.\n(\ngh-23376\n)\nSupport for\ny=\nas an alias of\nout=\nhas been removed. The\nfix\n,\nisposinf\nand\nisneginf\nfunctions allowed using\ny=\nas a\n(deprecated) alias for\nout=\n. This is no longer supported.\n(\ngh-23376\n)\nCompatibility notes\nThe\nbusday_count\nmethod now correctly handles cases where the\nbegindates\nis later in time than the\nenddates\n. Previously, the\nenddates\nwas included, even though the documentation states it is\nalways excluded.\n(\ngh-23229\n)\nWhen comparing datetimes and timedelta using\nnp.equal\nor\nnp.not_equal\nnumpy previously allowed the comparison with\ncasting=\"unsafe\"\n. This operation now fails. Forcing the output\ndtype using the\ndtype\nkwarg can make the operation succeed, but we\ndo not recommend it.\n(\ngh-22707\n)\nWhen loading data from a file handle using\nnp.load\n, if the handle\nis at the end of file, as can happen when reading multiple arrays by\ncalling\nnp.load\nrepeatedly, numpy previously raised\nValueError\nif\nallow_pickle=False\n, and\nOSError\nif\nallow_pickle=True\n. Now\nit raises\nEOFError\ninstead, in both cases.\n(\ngh-23105\n)\nnp.pad\nwith\nmode=wrap\npads with strict multiples of original data\nCode based on earlier version of\npad\nthat uses\nmode=\"wrap\"\nwill\nreturn different results when the padding size is larger than initial\narray.\nnp.pad\nwith\nmode=wrap\nnow always fills the space with strict\nmultiples of original data even if the padding size is larger than the\ninitial array.\n(\ngh-22575\n)\nCython\nlong_t\nand\nulong_t\nremoved\nlong_t\nand\nulong_t\nwere aliases for\nlonglong_t\nand\nulonglong_t\nand confusing (a remainder from of Python 2). This change may lead to\nthe errors:\n'long_t' is not a type identifier\n'ulong_t' is not a type identifier\nWe recommend use of bit-sized types such as\ncnp.int64_t\nor the use of\ncnp.intp_t\nwhich is 32 bits on 32 bit systems and 64 bits on 64 bit\nsystems (this is most compatible with indexing). If C\nlong\nis desired,\nuse plain\nlong\nor\nnpy_long\n.\ncnp.int_t\nis also\nlong\n(NumPy's\ndefault integer). However,\nlong\nis 32 bit on 64 bit windows and we may\nwish to adjust this even in NumPy. (Please do not hesitate to contact\nNumPy developers if you are curious about this.)\n(\ngh-22637\n)\nChanged error message and type for bad\naxes\nargument to\nufunc\nThe error message and type when a wrong\naxes\nvalue is passed to\nufunc(..., axes=[...])\nhas changed. The message is now more\nindicative of the problem, and if the value is mismatched an\nAxisError\nwill be raised. A\nTypeError\nwill still be raised for\ninvalidinput types.\n(\ngh-22675\n)\nArray-likes that define\n__array_ufunc__\ncan now override ufuncs if used as\nwhere\nIf the\nwhere\nkeyword argument of a\nnumpy.ufunc\n{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} is a subclass of\nnumpy.ndarray\n{.interpreted-text\nrole=\"class\"} or is a duck type that defines\nnumpy.class.__array_ufunc__\n{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"} it can\noverride the behavior of the ufunc using the same mechanism as the input\nand output arguments. Note that for this to work properly, the\nwhere.__array_ufunc__\nimplementation will have to unwrap the\nwhere\nargument to pass it into the default implementation of the\nufunc\nor,\nfor\nnumpy.ndarray\n{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} subclasses before\nusing\nsuper().__array_ufunc__\n.\n(\ngh-23240\n)\nCompiling against the NumPy C API is now backwards compatible by default\nNumPy now defaults to exposing a backwards compatible subset of the\nC-API. This makes the use of\noldest-supported-numpy\nunnecessary.\nLibraries can override the default minimal version to be compatible with\nusing:\n#define NPY_TARGET_VERSION NPY_1_22_API_VERSION\nbefore including NumPy or by passing the equivalent\n-D\noption to the\ncompiler. The NumPy 1.25 default is\nNPY_1_19_API_VERSION\n. Because the\nNumPy 1.19 C API was identical to the NumPy 1.16 one resulting programs\nwill be compatible with NumPy 1.16 (from a C-API perspective). This\ndefault will be increased in future non-bugfix releases. You can still\ncompile against an older NumPy version and run on a newer one.\nFor more details please see\nfor-downstream-package-authors\n{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}.\n(\ngh-23528\n)\nNew Features\nnp.einsum\nnow accepts arrays with\nobject\ndtype\nThe code path will call python operators on object dtype arrays, much\nlike\nnp.dot\nand\nnp.matmul\n.\n(\ngh-18053\n)\nAdd support for inplace matrix multiplication\nIt is now possible to perform inplace matrix multiplication via the\n@=\noperator.\n>\n>>\nimport\nnumpy\nas\nnp\n>\n>>\na\n=\nnp\n.\narange\n(\n6\n).\nreshape\n(\n3\n,\n2\n)\n>\n>>\nprint\n(\na\n)\n[[\n0\n1\n]\n [\n2\n3\n]\n [\n4\n5\n]]\n>\n>>\nb\n=\nnp\n.\nones\n((\n2\n,\n2\n),\ndtype\n=\nint\n)\n>\n>>\na\n@=\nb\n>\n>>\nprint\n(\na\n)\n[[\n1\n1\n]\n [\n5\n5\n]\n [\n9\n9\n]]\n(\ngh-21120\n)\nAdded\nNPY_ENABLE_CPU_FEATURES\nenvironment variable\nUsers may now choose to enable only a subset of the built CPU features\nat runtime by specifying the\nNPY_ENABLE_CPU_FEATURES\nenvironment variable. Note that these specified features must be outside\nthe baseline, since those are always assumed. Errors will be raised if\nattempting to enable a feature that is either not supported by your CPU,\nor that NumPy was not built with.\n(\ngh-22137\n)\nNumPy now has an\nnp.exceptions\nnamespace\nNumPy now has a dedicated namespace making most exceptions and warnings\navailable. All of these remain available in the main namespace, although\nsome may be moved slowly in the future. The main reason for this is to\nincrease discoverability and add future exceptions.\n(\ngh-22644\n)\nnp.linalg\nfunctions return NamedTuples\nnp.linalg\nfunctions that return tuples now return namedtuples. These\nfunctions are\neig()\n,\neigh()\n,\nqr()\n,\nslogdet()\n, and\nsvd()\n. The\nreturn type is unchanged in instances where these functions return\nnon-tuples with certain keyword arguments (like\nsvd(compute_uv=False)\n).\n(\ngh-22786\n)\nString functions in\nnp.char\nare compatible with NEP 42 custom dtypes\nCustom dtypes that represent unicode strings or byte strings can now be\npassed to the string functions in\nnp.char\n.\n(\ngh-22863\n)\nString dtype instances can be created from the string abstract dtype classes\nIt is now possible to create a string dtype instance with a size without\nusing the string name of the dtype. For example,\ntype(np.dtype('U'))(8)\nwill create a dtype that is equivalent to\nnp.dtype('U8')\n. This feature is most useful when writing generic code\ndealing with string dtype classes.\n(\ngh-22963\n)\nFujitsu C/C++ compiler is now supported\nSupport for Fujitsu compiler has been added. To build with Fujitsu\ncompiler, run:\npython setup.py build -c fujitsu\nSSL2 is now supported\nSupport for SSL2 has been added. SSL2 is a library that provides\nOpenBLAS compatible GEMM functions. To enable SSL2, it need to edit\nsite.cfg and build with Fujitsu compiler. See site.cfg.example.\n(\ngh-22982\n)\nImprovements\nNDArrayOperatorsMixin\nspecifies that it has no\n__slots__\nThe\nNDArrayOperatorsMixin\nclass now specifies that it contains no\n__slots__\n, ensuring that subclasses can now make use of this feature\nin Python.\n(\ngh-23113\n)\nFix power of complex zero\nnp.power\nnow returns a different result for\n0^{non-zero}\nfor complex\nnumbers. Note that the value is only defined when the real part of the\nexponent is larger than zero. Previously, NaN was returned unless the\nimaginary part was strictly zero. The return value is either\n0+0j\nor\n0-0j\n.\n(\ngh-18535\n)\nNew\nDTypePromotionError\nNumPy now has a new\nDTypePromotionError\nwhich is used when two dtypes\ncannot be promoted to a common one, for example:\nnp.result_type(\"M8[s]\", np.complex128)\nraises this new exception.\n(\ngh-22707\n)\nnp.show_config\nuses information from Meson\nBuild and system information now contains information from Meson.\nnp.show_config\nnow has a new optional parameter\nmode\nto\nhelp customize the output.\n(\ngh-22769\n)\nFix\nnp.ma.diff\nnot preserving the mask when called with arguments prepend/append.\nCalling\nnp.ma.diff\nwith arguments prepend and/or append now returns a\nMaskedArray\nwith the input mask preserved.\nPreviously, a\nMaskedArray\nwithout the mask was returned.\n(\ngh-22776\n)\nCorrected error handling for NumPy C-API in Cython\nMany NumPy C functions defined for use in Cython were lacking the\ncorrect error indicator like\nexcept -1\nor\nexcept *\n. These have now\nbeen added.\n(\ngh-22997\n)\nAbility to directly spawn random number generators\nnumpy.random.Generator.spawn\nnow allows to directly spawn new independent\nchild generators via the\nnumpy.random.SeedSequence.spawn\nmechanism.\nnumpy.random.BitGenerator.spawn\ndoes the same for the underlying bit\ngenerator.\nAdditionally,\nnumpy.random.BitGenerator.seed_seq\nnow gives\ndirect access to the seed sequence used for initializing the bit\ngenerator. This allows for example:\nseed = 0x2e09b90939db40c400f8f22dae617151\nrng = np.random.default_rng(seed)\nchild_rng1, child_rng2 = rng.spawn(2)\n\n# safely use rng, child_rng1, and child_rng2\nPreviously, this was hard to do without passing the\nSeedSequence\nexplicitly. Please see\nnumpy.random.SeedSequence\nfor more\ninformation.\n(\ngh-23195\n)\nnumpy.logspace\nnow supports a non-scalar\nbase\nargument\nThe\nbase\nargument of\nnumpy.logspace\ncan now be array-like if it is\nbroadcastable against the\nstart\nand\nstop\narguments.\n(\ngh-23275\n)\nnp.ma.dot()\nnow supports for non-2d arrays\nPreviously\nnp.ma.dot()\nonly worked if\na\nand\nb\nwere both 2d. Now it\nworks for non-2d arrays as well as\nnp.dot()\n.\n(\ngh-23322\n)\nExplicitly show keys of .npz file in repr\nNpzFile\nshows keys of loaded .npz file when printed.\n>\n>>\nnpzfile\n=\nnp\n.\nload\n(\n'arr.npz'\n)\n>\n>>\nnpzfile\nNpzFile\n'arr.npz'\nwith\nkeys\narr_0\n,\narr_1\n,\narr_2\n,\narr_3\n,\narr_4\n...\n(\ngh-23357\n)\nNumPy now exposes DType classes in\nnp.dtypes\nThe new\nnumpy.dtypes\nmodule now exposes DType classes and will contain\nfuture dtype related functionality. Most users should have no need to\nuse these classes directly.\n(\ngh-23358\n)\nDrop dtype metadata before saving in .npy or .npz files\nCurrently, a\n*.npy\nfile containing a table with a dtype with metadata cannot\nbe read back. Now,\nnp.save\nand\nnp.savez\ndrop metadata before saving.\n(\ngh-23371\n)\nnumpy.lib.recfunctions.structured_to_unstructured\nreturns views in more cases\nstructured_to_unstructured\nnow returns a view, if the stride between\nthe fields is constant. Prior, padding between the fields or a reversed\nfield would lead to a copy. This change only applies to\nndarray\n,\nmemmap\nand\nrecarray\n. For all other array subclasses, the behavior\nremains unchanged.\n(\ngh-23652\n)\nSigned and unsigned integers always compare correctly\nWhen\nuint64\nand\nint64\nare mixed in NumPy, NumPy typically promotes\nboth to\nfloat64\n. This behavior may be argued about but is confusing\nfor comparisons\n==\n,\n<=\n, since the results returned can be incorrect\nbut the conversion is hidden since the result is a boolean. NumPy will\nnow return the correct results for these by avoiding the cast to float.\n(\ngh-23713\n)\nPerformance improvements and changes\nFaster\nnp.argsort\non AVX-512 enabled processors\n32-bit and 64-bit quicksort algorithm for np.argsort gain up to 6x speed\nup on processors that support AVX-512 instruction set.\nThanks to\nIntel corporation\nfor sponsoring\nthis work.\n(\ngh-23707\n)\nFaster\nnp.sort\non AVX-512 enabled processors\nQuicksort for 16-bit and 64-bit dtypes gain up to 15x and 9x speed up on\nprocessors that support AVX-512 instruction set.\nThanks to\nIntel corporation\nfor sponsoring\nthis work.\n(\ngh-22315\n)\n__array_function__\nmachinery is now much faster\nThe overhead of the majority of functions in NumPy is now smaller\nespecially when keyword arguments are used. This change significantly\nspeeds up many simple function calls.\n(\ngh-23020\n)\nufunc.at\ncan be much faster\nGeneric\nufunc.at\ncan be up to 9x faster. The conditions for this\nspeedup:\noperands are aligned\nno casting\nIf ufuncs with appropriate indexed loops on 1d arguments with the above\nconditions,\nufunc.at\ncan be up to 60x faster (an additional 7x\nspeedup). Appropriate indexed loops have been added to\nadd\n,\nsubtract\n,\nmultiply\n,\nfloor_divide\n,\nmaximum\n,\nminimum\n,\nfmax\n,\nand\nfmin\n.\nThe internal logic is similar to the logic used for regular ufuncs,\nwhich also have fast paths.\nThanks to the\nD. E. Shaw group\nfor sponsoring\nthis work.\n(\ngh-23136\n)\nFaster membership test on\nNpzFile\nMembership test on\nNpzFile\nwill no longer decompress the archive if it\nis successful.\n(\ngh-23661\n)\nChanges\nnp.r_[]\nand\nnp.c_[]\nwith certain scalar values\nIn rare cases, using mainly\nnp.r_\nwith scalars can lead to different\nresults. The main potential changes are highlighted by the following:\n>>> np.r_[np.arange(5, dtype=np.uint8), -1].dtype\nint16  # rather than the default integer (int64 or int32)\n>>> np.r_[np.arange(5, dtype=np.int8), 255]\narray([  0,   1,   2,   3,   4, 255], dtype=int16)\nWhere the second example returned:\narray([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4, -1], dtype=int8)\nThe first one is due to a signed integer scalar with an unsigned integer\narray, while the second is due to\n255\nnot fitting into\nint8\nand\nNumPy currently inspecting values to make this work. (Note that the\nsecond example is expected to change in the future due to\nNEP 50 <NEP50>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}; it will then raise an\nerror.)\n(\ngh-22539\n)\nMost NumPy functions are wrapped into a C-callable\nTo speed up the\n__array_function__\ndispatching, most NumPy functions\nare now wrapped into C-callables and are not proper Python functions or\nC methods. They still look and feel the same as before (like a Python\nfunction), and this should only improve performance and user experience\n(cleaner tracebacks). However, please inform the NumPy developers if\nthis change confuses your program for some reason.\n(\ngh-23020\n)\nC++ standard library usage\nNumPy builds now depend on the C++ standard library, because the\nnumpy.core._multiarray_umath\nextension is linked with the C++ linker.\n(\ngh-23601\n)\nChecksums\nMD5\n4657f046d9d9d62e4baeae9b2cc1b4ea

    "content": "NumPy 2.3.0 Release Notes\nThe NumPy 2.3.0 release continues the work to improve free threaded\nPython support and annotations together with the usual set of bug fixes.\nIt is unusual in the number of expired deprecations, code\nmodernizations, and style cleanups. The latter may not be visible to\nusers, but is important for code maintenance over the long term. Note\nthat we have also upgraded from manylinux2014 to manylinux_2_28.\nUsers running on a Mac having an M4 cpu might see various warnings about\ninvalid values and such. The warnings are a known problem with\nAccelerate. They are annoying, but otherwise harmless. Apple promises to\nfix them.\nThis release supports Python versions 3.11-3.13, Python 3.14 will be\nsupported when it is released.\nHighlights\nInteractive examples in the NumPy documentation.\nBuilding NumPy with OpenMP Parallelization.\nPreliminary support for Windows on ARM.\nImproved support for free threaded Python.\nImproved annotations.\nNew functions\nNew function\nnumpy.strings.slice\nThe new function\nnumpy.strings.slice\nwas added, which implements fast\nnative slicing of string arrays. It supports the full slicing API\nincluding negative slice offsets and steps.\n(\ngh-27789\n)\nDeprecations\nThe\nnumpy.typing.mypy_plugin\nhas been deprecated in favor of\nplatform-agnostic static type inference. Please remove\nnumpy.typing.mypy_plugin\nfrom the\nplugins\nsection of your mypy\nconfiguration. If this change results in new errors being reported,\nkindly open an issue.\n(\ngh-28129\n)\nThe\nnumpy.typing.NBitBase\ntype has been deprecated and will be\nremoved in a future version.\nThis type was previously intended to be used as a generic upper\nbound for type-parameters, for example:\nimport\nnumpy\nas\nnp\nimport\nnumpy\n.\ntyping\nas\nnpt\ndef\nf\n[\nNT\n:\nnpt\n.\nNBitBase\n](\nx\n:\nnp\n.\ncomplexfloating\n[\nNT\n])\n->\nnp\n.\nfloating\n[\nNT\n]: ...\nBut in NumPy 2.2.0,\nfloat64\nand\ncomplex128\nwere changed to\nconcrete subtypes, causing static type-checkers to reject\nx: np.float64 = f(np.complex128(42j))\n.\nSo instead, the better approach is to use\ntyping.overload\n:\nimport\nnumpy\nas\nnp\nfrom\ntyping\nimport\noverload\n@\noverload\ndef\nf\n(\nx\n:\nnp\n.\ncomplex64\n)\n->\nnp\n.\nfloat32\n: ...\n@\noverload\ndef\nf\n(\nx\n:\nnp\n.\ncomplex128\n)\n->\nnp\n.\nfloat64\n: ...\n@\noverload\ndef\nf\n(\nx\n:\nnp\n.\nclongdouble\n)\n->\nnp\n.\nlongdouble\n: ...\n(\ngh-28884\n)\nExpired deprecations\nRemove deprecated macros like\nNPY_OWNDATA\nfrom Cython interfaces\nin favor of\nNPY_ARRAY_OWNDATA\n(deprecated since 1.7)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRemove\nnumpy/npy_1_7_deprecated_api.h\nand C macros like\nNPY_OWNDATA\nin favor of\nNPY_ARRAY_OWNDATA\n(deprecated since 1.7)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRemove alias\ngenerate_divbyzero_error\nto\nnpy_set_floatstatus_divbyzero\nand\ngenerate_overflow_error\nto\nnpy_set_floatstatus_overflow\n(deprecated since 1.10)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRemove\nnp.tostring\n(deprecated since 1.19)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRaise on\nnp.conjugate\nof non-numeric types (deprecated since 1.13)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRaise when using\nnp.bincount(...minlength=None)\n, use 0 instead\n(deprecated since 1.14)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nPassing\nshape=None\nto functions with a non-optional shape argument\nerrors, use\n()\ninstead (deprecated since 1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nInexact matches for\nmode\nand\nsearchside\nraise (deprecated since\n1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nSetting\n__array_finalize__ = None\nerrors (deprecated since 1.23)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nnp.fromfile\nand\nnp.fromstring\nerror on bad data, previously they\nwould guess (deprecated since 1.18)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\ndatetime64\nand\ntimedelta64\nconstruction with a tuple no longer\naccepts an\nevent\nvalue, either use a two-tuple of (unit, num) or a\n4-tuple of (unit, num, den, 1) (deprecated since 1.14)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nWhen constructing a\ndtype\nfrom a class with a\ndtype\nattribute,\nthat attribute must be a dtype-instance rather than a thing that can\nbe parsed as a dtype instance (deprecated in 1.19). At some point\nthe whole construct of using a dtype attribute will be deprecated\n(see\n#25306\n)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nPassing booleans as partition index errors (deprecated since 1.23)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nOut-of-bounds indexes error even on empty arrays (deprecated since\n1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nnp.tostring\nhas been removed, use\ntobytes\ninstead (deprecated\nsince 1.19)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nDisallow make a non-writeable array writeable for arrays with a base\nthat do not own their data (deprecated since 1.17)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nconcatenate()\nwith\naxis=None\nuses\nsame-kind\ncasting by\ndefault, not\nunsafe\n(deprecated since 1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nUnpickling a scalar with object dtype errors (deprecated since 1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nThe binary mode of\nfromstring\nnow errors, use\nfrombuffer\ninstead\n(deprecated since 1.14)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nConverting\nnp.inexact\nor\nnp.floating\nto a dtype errors\n(deprecated since 1.19)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nConverting\nnp.complex\n,\nnp.integer\n,\nnp.signedinteger\n,\nnp.unsignedinteger\n,\nnp.generic\nto a dtype errors (deprecated\nsince 1.19)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nThe Python built-in\nround\nerrors for complex scalars.

Convert to a\nndarray via\nmatrix.A\n(deprecated since 1.20)\n(\ngh-28254\n)\nRemoved the\nnp.compat\npackage source code (removed in 2.0)\n(\ngh-28961\n)\nC API changes\nNpyIter_GetTransferFlags\nis now available to check if the iterator\nneeds the Python API or if casts may cause floating point errors\n(FPE). FPEs can for example be set when casting\nfloat64(1e300)\nto\nfloat32\n(overflow to infinity) or a NaN to an integer (invalid\nvalue).\n(\ngh-27883\n)\nNpyIter\nnow has no limit on the number of operands it supports.\n(\ngh-28080\n)\nNew\nNpyIter_GetTransferFlags\nand\nNpyIter_IterationNeedsAPI\nchange\nNumPy now has the new\nNpyIter_GetTransferFlags\nfunction as a more\nprecise way checking of iterator/buffering needs. I.e. whether the\nPython API/GIL is required or floating point errors may occur. This\nfunction is also faster if you already know your needs without\nbuffering.\nThe\nNpyIter_IterationNeedsAPI\nfunction now performs all the checks\nthat were previously performed at setup time. While it was never\nnecessary to call it multiple times, doing so will now have a larger\ncost.\n(\ngh-27998\n)\nNew Features\nThe type parameter of\nnp.dtype\nnow defaults to\ntyping.Any\n. This\nway, static type-checkers will infer\ndtype: np.dtype\nas\ndtype: np.dtype[Any]\n, without reporting an error.\n(\ngh-28669\n)\nStatic type-checkers now interpret:\n_: np.ndarray\nas\n_: npt.NDArray[typing.Any]\n.\n_: np.flatiter\nas\n_: np.flatiter[np.ndarray]\n.\nThis is because their type parameters now have default values.\n(\ngh-28940\n)\nNumPy now registers its pkg-config paths with the\npkgconf\nPyPI package\nThe\npkgconf\nPyPI\npackage provides an interface for projects like NumPy to register their\nown paths to be added to the pkg-config search path. This means that\nwhen using\npkgconf\nfrom PyPI, NumPy will be discoverable without needing for any custom\nenvironment configuration.\nNote\nThis only applies when using the\npkgconf\npackage from\nPyPI\n,\nor put another way, this only applies when installing\npkgconf\nvia a\nPython package manager.\nIf you are using\npkg-config\nor\npkgconf\nprovided by your system,\nor any other source that does not use the\npkgconf-pypi\nproject, the NumPy pkg-config directory will not be automatically added\nto the search path. In these situations, you might want to use\nnumpy-config\n.\n(\ngh-28214\n)\nAllow\nout=...\nin ufuncs to ensure array result\nNumPy has the sometimes difficult behavior that it currently usually\nreturns scalars rather than 0-D arrays (even if the inputs were 0-D\narrays). This is especially problematic for non-numerical dtypes (e.g.\nobject\n).\nFor ufuncs (i.e. most simple math functions) it is now possible to use\nout=...\n(literally `...`, e.g.\nout=Ellipsis\n) which is identical\nin behavior to\nout\nnot being passed, but will ensure a non-scalar\nreturn. This spelling is borrowed from\narr1d[0, ...]\nwhere the\n...\nalso ensures a non-scalar return.\nOther functions with an\nout=\nkwarg should gain support eventually.\nDownstream libraries that interoperate via\n__array_ufunc__\nor\n__array_function__\nmay need to adapt to support this.\n(\ngh-28576\n)\nBuilding NumPy with OpenMP Parallelization\nNumPy now supports OpenMP parallel processing capabilities when built\nwith the\n-Denable_openmp=true\nMeson build flag. This feature is\ndisabled by default. When enabled,\nnp.sort\nand\nnp.argsort\nfunctions\ncan utilize OpenMP for parallel thread execution, improving performance\nfor these operations.\n(\ngh-28619\n)\nInteractive examples in the NumPy documentation\nThe NumPy documentation includes a number of examples that can now be\nrun interactively in your browser using WebAssembly and Pyodide.\nPlease note that the examples are currently experimental in nature and\nmay not work as expected for all methods in the public API.\n(\ngh-26745\n)\nImprovements\nScalar comparisons between non-comparable dtypes such as\nnp.array(1) == np.array('s')\nnow return a NumPy bool instead of a\nPython bool.\n(\ngh-27288\n)\nnp.nditer\nnow has no limit on the number of supported operands\n(C-integer).\n(\ngh-28080\n)\nNo-copy pickling is now supported for any array that can be\ntransposed to a C-contiguous array.\n(\ngh-28105\n)\nThe\n__repr__\nfor user-defined dtypes now prefers the\n__name__\nof\nthe custom dtype over a more generic name constructed from its\nkind\nand\nitemsize\n.\n(\ngh-28250\n)\nnp.dot\nnow reports floating point exceptions.\n(\ngh-28442\n)\nnp.dtypes.StringDType\nis now a\ngeneric\ntype\nwhich\naccepts a type argument for\nna_object\nthat defaults to\ntyping.Never\n. For example,\nStringDType(na_object=None)\nreturns a\nStringDType[None]\n, and\nStringDType()\nreturns a\nStringDType[typing.Never]\n.\n(\ngh-28856\n)\nAdded warnings to\nnp.isclose\nAdded warning messages if at least one of atol or rtol are either\nnp.nan\nor\nnp.inf\nwithin\nnp.isclose\n.\nWarnings follow the user's\nnp.seterr\nsettings\n(\ngh-28205\n)\nPerformance improvements and changes\nPerformance improvements to\nnp.unique\nnp.unique\nnow tries to use a hash table to find unique values instead\nof sorting values before finding unique values. This is limited to\ncertain dtypes for now, and the function is now faster for those dtypes.\nThe function now also exposes a\nsorted\nparameter to allow returning\nunique values as they were found, instead of sorting them afterwards.\n(\ngh-26018\n)\nPerformance improvements to\nnp.sort\nand\nnp.argsort\nnp.sort\nand\nnp.argsort\nfunctions now can leverage OpenMP for\nparallel thread execution, resulting in up to 3.5x speedups on x86\narchitectures with AVX2 or AVX-512 instructions. This opt-in feature\nrequires NumPy to be built with the -Denable_openmp Meson flag. Users\ncan control the number of threads used by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS\nenvironment variable.\n(\ngh-28619\n)\nPerformance improvements for\nnp.float16\ncasts\nEarlier, floating point casts to and from\nnp.float16\ntypes were\nemulated in software on all platforms.\nNow, on ARM devices that support Neon float16 intrinsics (such as recent\nApple Silicon), the native float16 path is used to achieve the best\nperformance.\n(\ngh-28769\n)\nChanges\nThe vector norm\nord=inf\nand the matrix norms\nord={1, 2, inf, 'nuc'}\nnow always returns zero for empty arrays.\nEmpty arrays have at least one axis of size zero. This affects\nnp.linalg.norm\n,\nnp.linalg.vector_norm\n, and\nnp.linalg.matrix_norm\n. Previously, NumPy would raises errors or\nreturn zero depending on the shape of the array.\n(\ngh-28343\n)\nA spelling error in the error message returned when converting a\nstring to a float with the method\nnp.format_float_positional\nhas\nbeen fixed.\n(\ngh-28569\n)\nNumPy's\n__array_api_version__\nwas upgraded from\n2023.12\nto\n2024.12\n.\nnumpy.count_nonzero\nfor\naxis=None\n(default) now returns a NumPy\nscalar instead of a Python integer.\nThe parameter\naxis\nin\nnumpy.take_along_axis\nfunction has now a\ndefault value of\n-1\n.\n(\ngh-28615\n)\nPrinting of\nnp.float16\nand\nnp.float32\nscalars and arrays have\nbeen improved by adjusting the transition to scientific notation\nbased on the floating point precision. A new legacy\nnp.printoptions\nmode\n'2.2'\nhas been added for backwards\ncompatibility.\n(\ngh-28703\n)\nMultiplication between a string and integer now raises OverflowError\ninstead of MemoryError if the result of the multiplication would\ncreate a string that is too large to be represented. This follows\nPython's behavior.\n(\ngh-29060\n)\nunique_values\nmay return unsorted data\nThe relatively new function (added in NumPy 2.0)\nunique_values\nmay now\nreturn unsorted results. Just as\nunique_counts\nand\nunique_all\nthese\nnever guaranteed a sorted result, however, the result was sorted until\nnow. In cases where these do return a sorted result, this may change in\nfuture releases to improve performance.\n(\ngh-26018\n)\nChanges to the main iterator and potential numerical changes\nThe main iterator, used in math functions and via\nnp.nditer\nfrom\nPython and\nNpyIter\nin C, now behaves differently for some buffered\niterations. This means that:\nThe buffer size used will often be smaller than the maximum buffer\nsized allowed by the\nbuffersize\nparameter.\nThe \"growinner\" flag is now honored with buffered reductions when\nno operand requires buffering.\nFor\nnp.sum()\nsuch changes in buffersize may slightly change numerical\nresults of floating point operations. Users who use \"growinner\" for\ncustom reductions could notice changes in precision (for example, in\nNumPy we removed it from\neinsum\nto avoid most precision changes and\nimprove precision for some 64bit floating point inputs).\n(\ngh-27883\n)\nThe minimum supported GCC version is now 9.3.0\nThe minimum supported version was updated from 8.4.0 to 9.3.0, primarily\nin order to reduce the chance of platform-specific bugs in old GCC\nversions from causing issues.\n(\ngh-28102\n)\nChanges to automatic bin selection in numpy.histogram\nThe automatic bin selection algorithm in\nnumpy.histogram\nhas been\nmodified to avoid out-of-memory errors for samples with low variation.\nFor full control over the selected bins the user can use set the\nbin\nor\nrange\nparameters of\nnumpy.histogram\n.\n(\ngh-28426\n)\nBuild manylinux_2_28 wheels\nWheels for linux systems will use the\nmanylinux_2_28\ntag (instead of\nthe\nmanylinux2014\ntag), which means dropping support for\nredhat7/centos7, amazonlinux2, debian9, ubuntu18.04, and other\npre-glibc2.28 operating system versions, as per the\nPEP 600 support\ntable\n.\n(\ngh-28436\n)\nRemove use of -Wl,-ld_classic on macOS\nRemove use of -Wl,-ld_classic on macOS. This hack is no longer needed by\nSpack, and results in libraries that cannot link to other libraries\nbuilt with ld (new).\n(\ngh-28713\n)\nRe-enable overriding functions in

    "content": "NumPy 2.0.0 Release Notes\nNumPy 2.0.0 is the first major release since 2006. It is the result of\n11 months of development since the last feature release and is the work\nof 212 contributors spread over 1078 pull requests. It contains a large\nnumber of exciting new features as well as changes to both the Python\nand C APIs.\nThis major release includes breaking changes that could not happen in a\nregular minor (feature) release - including an ABI break, changes to\ntype promotion rules, and API changes which may not have been emitting\ndeprecation warnings in 1.26.x. Key documents related to how to adapt to\nchanges in NumPy 2.0, in addition to these release notes, include:\nThe\nnumpy-2-migration-guide\nThe Numpy 2.0-specific advice in\nfor downstream package authors\nHighlights\nHighlights of this release include:\nNew features:\nA new variable-length string dtype,\nnumpy.dtypes.StringDType\nand a new\nnumpy.strings\nnamespace with performant ufuncs for string operations,\nSupport for\nfloat32\nand\nlongdouble\nin all\nnumpy.fft\nfunctions,\nSupport for the array API standard in the main\nnumpy\nnamespace.\nPerformance improvements:\nSorting functions\nsort\n,\nargsort\n,\npartition\n,\nargpartition\nhave been\naccelerated through the use of the Intel x86-simd-sort and\nGoogle Highway libraries, and may see large (hardware-specific)\nspeedups,\nmacOS Accelerate support and binary wheels for macOS >=14, with\nsignificant performance improvements for linear algebra\noperations on macOS, and wheels that are about 3 times smaller,\nnumpy.char\nfixed-length string operations have\nbeen accelerated by implementing ufuncs that also support\nnumpy.dtypes.StringDType\nin addition to the\nfixed-length string dtypes,\nA new tracing and introspection API,\nnumpy.lib.introspect.opt_func_info\n, to determine\nwhich hardware-specific kernels are available and will be\ndispatched to.\nnumpy.save\nnow uses pickle protocol version 4 for saving\narrays with object dtype, which allows for pickle objects larger\nthan 4GB and improves saving speed by about 5% for large arrays.\nPython API improvements:\nA clear split between public and private API, with a new module\nstructure and each public function now available in a single place.\nMany removals of non-recommended functions and aliases. This\nshould make it easier to learn and use NumPy. The number of\nobjects in the main namespace decreased by ~10% and in\nnumpy.lib\nby ~80%.\nCanonical dtype names and a new\nnumpy.isdtype` introspection\nfunction,\nC API improvements:\nA new public C API for creating custom dtypes,\nMany outdated functions and macros removed, and private\ninternals hidden to ease future extensibility,\nNew, easier to use, initialization functions:\nPyArray_ImportNumPyAPI\nand\nPyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI\n.\nImproved behavior:\nImprovements to type promotion behavior was changed by adopting NEP 50.\nThis fixes many user surprises about promotions which previously often\ndepended on data values of input arrays rather than only their dtypes.\nPlease see the NEP and the numpy-2-migration-guide for details as this\nchange can lead to changes in output dtypes and lower precision results\nfor mixed-dtype operations.\nThe default integer type on Windows is now\nint64\nrather than\nint32\n, matching the behavior on other platforms,\nThe maximum number of array dimensions is changed from 32 to 64\nDocumentation:\nThe reference guide navigation was significantly improved, and\nthere is now documentation on NumPy's\nmodule structure,\nThe building from source documentation was completely rewritten,\nFurthermore there are many changes to NumPy internals, including\ncontinuing to migrate code from C to C++, that will make it easier to\nimprove and maintain NumPy in the future.\nThe \"no free lunch\" theorem dictates that there is a price to pay for\nall these API and behavior improvements and better future extensibility.\nThis price is:\nBackwards compatibility. There are a significant number of breaking\nchanges to both the Python and C APIs. In the majority of cases,\nthere are clear error messages that will inform the user how to\nadapt their code. However, there are also changes in behavior for\nwhich it was not possible to give such an error message - these\ncases are all covered in the Deprecation and Compatibility sections\nbelow, and in the numpy-2-migration-guide.\nNote that there is a\nruff\nmode to auto-fix many things in Python\ncode.\nBreaking changes to the NumPy ABI. As a result, binaries of packages\nthat use the NumPy C API and were built against a NumPy 1.xx release\nwill not work with NumPy 2.0. On import, such packages will see an\nImportError\nwith a message about binary incompatibility.\nIt is possible to build binaries against NumPy 2.0 that will work at\nruntime with both NumPy 2.0 and 1.x. See numpy-2-abi-handling for more\ndetails.\nAll downstream packages that depend on the NumPy ABI are advised\nto do a new release built against NumPy 2.0 and verify that that\nrelease works with both 2.0 and 1.26 - ideally in the period between\n2.0.0rc1 (which will be ABI-stable) and the final 2.0.0 release to\navoid problems for their users.\nThe Python versions supported by this release are 3.9-3.12.\nNumPy 2.0 Python API removals\nnp.geterrobj\n,\nnp.seterrobj\nand the related ufunc keyword\nargument\nextobj=\nhave been removed. The preferred replacement for\nall of these is using the context manager\nwith np.errstate():\n.\n(\ngh-23922\n)\nnp.cast\nhas been removed. The literal replacement for\nnp.cast[dtype](arg)\nis\nnp.asarray(arg, dtype=dtype)\n.\nnp.source\nhas been removed. The preferred replacement is\ninspect.getsource\n.\nnp.lookfor\nhas been removed.\n(\ngh-24144\n)\nnumpy.who\nhas been removed. As an alternative for the removed\nfunctionality, one can use a variable explorer that is available in\nIDEs such as Spyder or Jupyter Notebook.\n(\ngh-24321\n)\nWarnings and exceptions present in\nnumpy.exceptions\n,\ne.g,\nnumpy.exceptions.ComplexWarning\n,\nnumpy.exceptions.VisibleDeprecationWarning\n, are no\nlonger exposed in the main namespace.\nMultiple niche enums, expired members and functions have been\nremoved from the main namespace, such as:\nERR_*\n,\nSHIFT_*\n,\nnp.fastCopyAndTranspose\n,\nnp.kernel_version\n,\nnp.numarray\n,\nnp.oldnumeric\nand\nnp.set_numeric_ops\n.\n(\ngh-24316\n)\nReplaced\nfrom ... import *\nin the\nnumpy/__init__.py\nwith\nexplicit imports. As a result, these main namespace members got\nremoved:\nnp.FLOATING_POINT_SUPPORT\n,\nnp.FPE_*\n,\nnp.NINF\n,\nnp.PINF\n,\nnp.NZERO\n,\nnp.PZERO\n,\nnp.CLIP\n,\nnp.WRAP\n,\nnp.WRAP\n,\nnp.RAISE\n,\nnp.BUFSIZE\n,\nnp.UFUNC_BUFSIZE_DEFAULT\n,\nnp.UFUNC_PYVALS_NAME\n,\nnp.ALLOW_THREADS\n,\nnp.MAXDIMS\n,\nnp.MAY_SHARE_EXACT\n,\nnp.MAY_SHARE_BOUNDS\n,\nadd_newdoc\n,\nnp.add_docstring\nand\nnp.add_newdoc_ufunc\n.\n(\ngh-24357\n)\nAlias\nnp.float_\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.float64\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.complex_\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.complex128\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.longfloat\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.longdouble\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.singlecomplex\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.complex64\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.cfloat\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.complex128\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.longcomplex\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.clongdouble\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.clongfloat\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.clongdouble\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.string_\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.bytes_\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.unicode_\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.str_\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.Inf\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.inf\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.Infinity\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.inf\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.NaN\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.nan\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.infty\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.inf\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.mat\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.asmatrix\ninstead.\nnp.issubclass_\nhas been removed. Use the\nissubclass\nbuiltin\ninstead.\nnp.asfarray\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.asarray\nwith a proper dtype\ninstead.\nnp.set_string_function\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.set_printoptions\ninstead with a formatter for custom printing of NumPy objects.\nnp.tracemalloc_domain\nis now only available from\nnp.lib\n.\nnp.recfromcsv\nand\nrecfromtxt\nare now only available from\nnp.lib.npyio\n.\nnp.issctype\n,\nnp.maximum_sctype\n,\nnp.obj2sctype\n,\nnp.sctype2char\n,\nnp.sctypes\n,\nnp.issubsctype\nwere all removed\nfrom the main namespace without replacement, as they where niche\nmembers.\nDeprecated\nnp.deprecate\nand\nnp.deprecate_with_doc\nhas been\nremoved from the main namespace. Use\nDeprecationWarning\ninstead.\nDeprecated\nnp.safe_eval\nhas been removed from the main namespace.\nUse\nast.literal_eval\ninstead.\n(\ngh-24376\n)\nnp.find_common_type\nhas been removed. Use\nnumpy.promote_types\nor\nnumpy.result_type\ninstead. To achieve semantics for the\nscalar_types\nargument, use\nnumpy.result_type\nand pass\n0\n,\n0.0\n, or\n0j\nas a Python scalar instead.\nnp.round_\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.round\ninstead.\nnp.nbytes\nhas been removed. Use\nnp.dtype(<dtype>).itemsize\ninstead.\n(\ngh-24477\n)\nnp.compare_chararrays\nhas been removed from the main namespace.\nUse\nnp.char.compare_chararrays\ninstead.\nThe\ncharrarray\nin the main namespace has been deprecated. It can\nbe imported without a deprecation warning from\nnp.char.chararray\nfor now, but we are planning to fully deprecate and remove\nchararray\nin the future.\nnp.format_parser\nhas been removed from the main namespace. Use\nnp.rec.format_parser\ninstead.\n(\ngh-24587\n)\nSupport for seven data type string aliases has been removed from\nnp.dtype\n:\nint0\n,\nuint0\n,\nvoid0\n,\nobject0\n,\nstr0\n,\nbytes0\nand\nbool8\n.\n(\ngh-24807\n)\nThe experimental\nnumpy.array_api\nsubmodule has been removed. Use\nthe main\nnumpy\nnamespace for regular usage instead, or the\nseparate\narray-api-strict\npackage for the compliance testing use\ncase for which\nnumpy.array_api\nwas mostly used.\n(\ngh-25911\n)\n__array_prepare__\nis removed\nUFuncs called\n__array_prepare__\nbefore running computations for normal\nufunc calls (not generalized ufuncs, reductions, etc.). The function was\nalso called instead of\n__array_wrap__\non the results of some linear\nalgebra functions.\nIt is now removed. If you use it, migrate to\n__array_ufunc__\nor rely\non\n__array_wrap__\nwhich is called with a context in all cases,\nalthough only after the result array is filled. In those code paths,\n__array_wrap__\nwill now be passed a base class, rather than a subclass\narray.\n(\ngh-25105\n)\nDeprecations\nnp.compat\nhas been deprecated, as Python 2 is no longer supported.\nnumpy.int8\nand similar classes will no longer support conversion\nof out of bounds python integers to integer arrays. For example,\nconversion of 255 to int8 will not return -1.\nnumpy.iinfo(dtype)\ncan be used to check the machine limits for data types. For example,\nnp.iinfo(np.uint16)\nreturns min = 0 and max = 65535.\nnp.array(value).astype(dtype)\nwill give the desired result.\nnp.safe_eval\nhas been deprecated.\nast.literal_eval\nshould be\nused instead.\n(\ngh-23830\n)\nnp.recfromcsv\n,\nnp.recfromtxt\n,\nnp.disp\n,\nnp.get_array_wrap\n,\nnp.maximum_sctype\n,\nnp.deprecate\nand\nnp.deprecate_with_doc\nhave\nbeen deprecated.\n(\ngh-24154\n)\nnp.trapz\nhas been deprecated. Use\nnp.trapezoid\nor a\nscipy.integrate\nfunction instead.\nnp.in1d\nhas been deprecated. Use\nnp.isin\ninstead.\nAlias\nnp.row_stack\nhas been deprecated. Use\nnp.vstack\ndirectly.\n(\ngh-24445\n)\n__array_wrap__\nis now passed\narr, context, return_scalar\nand\nsupport for implementations not accepting all three are deprecated.\nIts signature should be\n__array_wrap__(self, arr, context=None, return_scalar=False)\n(\ngh-25409\n)\nArrays of 2-dimensional vectors for\nnp.cross\nhave been deprecated.\nUse arrays of 3-dimensional vectors instead.\n(\ngh-24818\n)\nnp.dtype(\"a\")\nalias for\nnp.dtype(np.bytes_)\nwas deprecated. Use\nnp.dtype(\"S\")\nalias instead.\n(\ngh-24854\n)\nUse of keyword arguments\nx\nand\ny\nwith functions\nassert_array_equal\nand\nassert_array_almost_equal\nhas been\ndeprecated. Pass the first two arguments as positional arguments\ninstead.\n(\ngh-24978\n)\nnumpy.fft\ndeprecations for n-D transforms with None values in arguments\nUsing\nfftn\n,\nifftn\n,\nrfftn\n,\nirfftn\n,\nfft2\n,\nifft2\n,\nrfft2\nor\nirfft2\nwith the\ns\nparameter set to a value that is not\nNone\nand\nthe\naxes\nparameter set to\nNone\nhas been deprecated, in line with the\narray API standard. To retain current behaviour, pass a sequence [0,\n..., k-1] to\naxes\nfor an array of dimension k.\nFurthermore, passing an array to\ns\nwhich contains\nNone\nvalues is\ndeprecated as the parameter is documented to accept a sequence of\nintegers in both the NumPy docs and the array API specification. To use\nthe default behaviour of the corresponding 1-D transform, pass the value\nmatching the default for its\nn\nparameter. To use the default behaviour\nfor every axis, the\ns\nargument can be omitted.\n(\ngh-25495\n)\nnp.linalg.lstsq\nnow defaults to a new\nrcond\nvalue\nnumpy.linalg.lstsq\nnow uses the new rcond value of the\nmachine precision times\nmax(M, N)\n. Previously, the machine precision\nwas used but a FutureWarning was given to notify that this change will\nhappen eventually. That old behavior can still be achieved by passing\nrcond=-1\n.\n(\ngh-25721\n)\nExpired deprecations\nThe\nnp.core.umath_tests\nsubmodule has been removed from the public\nAPI. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.15)\n(\ngh-23809\n)\nThe\nPyDataMem_SetEventHook\ndeprecation has expired and it is\nremoved. Use\ntracemalloc\nand the\nnp.lib.tracemalloc_domain\ndomain. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.23)\n(\ngh-23921\n)\nThe deprecation of\nset_numeric_ops\nand the C functions\nPyArray_SetNumericOps\nand\nPyArray_GetNumericOps\nhas been expired\nand the functions removed. (Deprecated in NumPy 1.16)\n(\ngh-23998\n)\nThe\nfasttake\n,\nfastclip\n, and\nfastputmask\nArrFuncs\ndeprecation\nis now finalized.\nThe deprecated function\nfastCopyAndTranspose\nand its C counterpart\nare now removed.\nThe deprecation of\nPyArray_ScalarFromObject\nis now finalized.\n(\ngh-24312\n)\nnp.msort\nhas been removed. For a replacement,\nnp.sort(a, axis=0)\nshould be used instead.\n(\ngh-24494\n)\nnp.dtype((\"f8\", 1)\nwill now return a shape 1 subarray dtype rather\nthan a non-subarray one.\n(\ngh-25761\n)\nAssigning to the\n.data\nattribute of an ndarray is disallowed and\nwill raise.\nnp.binary_repr(a, width)\nwill raise if width is too small.\nUsing\nNPY_CHAR\nin\nPyArray_DescrFromType()\nwill raise, use\nNPY_STRING\nNPY_UNICODE\n, or\nNPY_VSTRING\ninstead.\n(\ngh-25794\n)\nCompatibility notes\nloadtxt\nand\ngenfromtxt\ndefault encoding changed\nloadtxt\nand\ngenfromtxt\nnow both default to\nencoding=None\nwhich may\nmainly modify how\nconverters\nwork. These will now be passed\nstr\nrather than\nbytes\n. Pass the encoding explicitly to always get the new\nor old behavior. For\ngenfromtxt\nthe change also means that returned\nvalues will now be unicode strings rather than bytes.\n(\ngh-25158\n)\nf2py\ncompatibility notes\nf2py\nwill no longer accept ambiguous\n-m\nand\n.pyf\nCLI\ncombinations. When more than one\n.pyf\nfile is passed, an error is\nraised. When both\n-m\nand a\n.pyf\nis passed, a warning is emitted\nand the\n-m\nprovided name is ignored.\n(\ngh-25181\n)\nThe\nf2py.compile()\nhelper has been removed because it leaked\nmemory, has been marked as experimental for several years now, and\nwas implemented as a thin\nsubprocess.run\nwrapper. It was also one\nof the test bottlenecks. See\ngh-25122\nfor the full\nrationale. It also used several\nnp.distutils\nfeatures which are\ntoo fragile to be ported to work with\nmeson\n.\nUsers are urged to replace calls to\nf2py.compile\nwith calls to\nsubprocess.run(\"python\", \"-m\", \"numpy.f2py\",...\ninstead, and to\nuse environment variables to interact with\nmeson\n.\nNative\nfiles\nare also an\noption.\n(\ngh-25193\n)\nMinor changes in behavior of sorting functions\nDue to algorithmic changes and use of SIMD code, sorting functions with\nmethods that aren't stable may return slightly different results in\n2.0.0 compared to 1.26.x. This includes the default method of\nnumpy.argsort\nand\nnumpy.argpartition\n.\nRemoved ambiguity when broadcasting in\nnp.solve\nThe broadcasting rules for\nnp.solve(a, b)\nwere ambiguous when\nb\nhad\n1 fewer dimensions than\na\n. This has been resolved in a\nbackward-incompatible way and is now compliant with the Array API. The\nold behaviour can be reconstructed by using\nnp.solve(a, b[..., None])[..., 0]\n.\n(\ngh-25914\n)\nModified representation for\nPolynomial\nThe representation method for\nnumpy.polynomial.polynomial.Polynomial\nwas updated to\ninclude the domain in the representation. The plain text and latex\nrepresentations are now consistent. For example the output of\nstr(np.polynomial.Polynomial([1, 1], domain=[.1, .2]))\nused to be\n1.0 + 1.0 x\n, but now is\n1.0 + 1.0 (-3.0000000000000004 + 20.0 x)\n.\n(\ngh-21760\n)\nC API changes\nThe\nPyArray_CGT\n,\nPyArray_CLT\n,\nPyArray_CGE\n,\nPyArray_CLE\n,\nPyArray_CEQ\n,\nPyArray_CNE\nmacros have been removed.\nPyArray_MIN\nand\nPyArray_MAX\nhave been moved from\nndarraytypes.h\nto\nnpy_math.h\n.\n(\ngh-24258\n)\nA C API for working with\nnumpy.dtypes.StringDType\narrays has been exposed. This includes functions for acquiring and\nreleasing mutexes which lock access to the string data, as well as\npacking and unpacking UTF-8 bytestreams from array entries.\nNPY_NTYPES\nhas been renamed to\nNPY_NTYPES_LEGACY\nas it does not\ninclude new NumPy built-in DTypes. In particular the new string\nDType will likely not work correctly with code that handles legacy\nDTypes.\n(\ngh-25347\n)\nThe C-API now only exports the static inline function versions of\nthe array accessors (previously this depended on using \"deprecated\nAPI\"). While we discourage it, the struct fields can still be used\ndirectly.\n(\ngh-25789\n)\nNumPy now defines\nPyArray_Pack\nto set an individual memory address.\nUnlike\nPyArray_SETITEM\nthis function is equivalent to setting an\nindividual array item and does not require a NumPy array input.\n(\ngh-25954\n)\nThe\n->f\nslot has been removed from\nPyArray_Descr\n. If you use this slot,\nreplace accessing it with\nPyDataType_GetArrFuncs\n(see its documentation\nand the\nnumpy-2-migration-guide\n). In some cases using other functions\nlike\nPyArray_GETITEM\nmay be an alternatives.\nPyArray_GETITEM\nand\nPyArray_SETITEM\nnow require the import of\nthe NumPy API table to be used and are no longer defined in\nndarraytypes.h\n.\n(\ngh-25812\n)\nDue to runtime dependencies, the definition for functionality\naccessing the dtype flags was moved from\nnumpy/ndarraytypes.h\nand\nis only available after including\nnumpy/ndarrayobject.h\nas it\nrequires\nimport_array()\n. This includes\nPyDataType_FLAGCHK\n,\nPyDataType_REFCHK\nand\nNPY_BEGIN_THREADS_DESCR\n.\nThe dtype flags on\nPyArray_Descr\nmust now be accessed through the\nPyDataType_FLAGS\ninline function to be compatible with both 1.x\nand 2.x. This function is defined in\nnpy_2_compat.h\nto allow\nbackporting. Most or all users should use\nPyDataType_FLAGCHK\nwhich\nis available on 1.x and does not require backporting. Cython users\nshould use Cython 3. Otherwise access will go through Python unless\nthey use\nPyDataType_FLAGCHK\ninstead.\n(\ngh-25816\n)\nDatetime functionality exposed in the C API and Cython bindings\nThe functions\nNpyDatetime_ConvertDatetime64ToDatetimeStruct\n,\nNpyDatetime_ConvertDatetimeStructToDatetime64\n,\nNpyDatetime_ConvertPyDateTimeToDatetimeStruct\n,\nNpyDatetime_GetDatetimeISO8601StrLen\n,\nNpyDatetime_MakeISO8601Datetime\n, and\nNpyDatetime_ParseISO8601Datetime\nhave been added to the C API to\nfacilitate converting between strings, Python datetimes, and NumPy\ndatetimes in external libraries.\n(\ngh-21199\n)\nConst correctness for the generalized ufunc C API\nThe NumPy C API's functions for constructing generalized ufuncs\n(\nPyUFunc_FromFuncAndData\n,\nPyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignature\n,\nPyUFunc_FromFuncAndDataAndSignatureAndIdentity\n) take\ntypes\nand\ndata\narguments that are not modified by NumPy's internals. Like the\nname\nand\ndoc\narguments, third-party Python extension modules are\nlikely to supply these arguments from static constants. The\ntypes\nand\ndata\narguments are now const-correct: they are declared as\nconst char *types\nand\nvoid *const *data\n, respectively. C code should\nnot be affected, but C++ code may be.\n(\ngh-23847\n)\nLarger\nNPY_MAXDIMS\nand\nNPY_MAXARGS\n,\nNPY_RAVEL_AXIS\nintroduced\nNPY_MAXDIMS\nis now 64, you may want to review its use. This is usually\nused in a stack allocation, where the increase should be safe. However,\nwe do encourage generally to remove any use of\nNPY_MAXDIMS\nand\nNPY_MAXARGS\nto eventually allow removing the constraint completely.\nFor the conversion helper and C-API functions mirroring Python ones such as\ntake\n,\nNPY_MAXDIMS\nwas used to mean\naxis=None\n. Such usage must be replaced\nwith\nNPY_RAVEL_AXIS\n. See also\nmigration_maxdims\n.\n(\ngh-25149\n)\nNPY_MAXARGS\nnot constant and\nPyArrayMultiIterObject\nsize change\nSince\nNPY_MAXARGS\nwas increased, it is now a runtime constant and not\ncompile-time constant anymore. We expect almost no users to notice this.\nBut if used for stack allocations it now must be replaced with a custom\nconstant using\nNPY_MAXARGS\nas an additional runtime check.\nThe\nsizeof(PyArrayMultiIterObject)\nno longer includes the full size of\nthe object. We expect nobody to notice this change. It was necessary to\navoid issues with Cython.\n(\ngh-25271\n)\nRequired changes for custom legacy user dtypes\nIn order to improve our DTypes it is unfortunately necessary to break\nthe ABI, which requires some changes for dtypes registered with\nPyArray_RegisterDataType\n. Please see the documentation of\nPyArray_RegisterDataType\nfor how to adapt your code and achieve\ncompatibility with both 1.x and 2.x.\n(\ngh-25792\n)\nNew Public DType API\nThe C implementation of the NEP 42 DType API is now public. While the\nDType API has shipped in NumPy for a few versions, it was only usable in\nsessions with a special environment variable set. It is now possible to\nwrite custom DTypes outside of NumPy using the new DType API and the\nnormal\nimport_array()\nmechanism for importing the numpy C API.\nSee\ndtype-api\nfor more details about the API. As always with a new feature,\nplease report any bugs you run into implementing or using a new DType. It is\nlikely that downstream C code that works with dtypes will need to be updated to\nwork correctly with new DTypes.\n(\ngh-25754\n)\nNew C-API import functions\nWe have now added\nPyArray_ImportNumPyAPI\nand\nPyUFunc_ImportUFuncAPI\nas static inline functions to import the NumPy C-API tables. The new\nfunctions have two advantages over\nimport_array\nand\nimport_ufunc\n:\nThey check whether the import was already performed and are\nlight-weight if not, allowing to add them judiciously (although this\nis not preferable in most cases).\nThe old mechanisms were macros rather than functions which included\na\nreturn\nstatement.\nThe\nPyArray_ImportNumPyAPI()\nfunction is included in\nnpy_2_compat.h\nfor simpler backporting.\n(\ngh-25866\n)\nStructured dtype information access through functions\nThe dtype structures fields\nc_metadata\n,\nnames\n,\nfields\n, and\nsubarray\nmust now be accessed through new functions following the same\nnames, such as\nPyDataType_NAMES\n. Direct access of the fields is not\nvalid as they do not exist for all\nPyArray_Descr\ninstances. The\nmetadata\nfield is kept, but the macro version should also be\npreferred.\n(\ngh-25802\n)\nDescriptor\nelsize\nand\nalignment\naccess\nUnless compiling only with NumPy 2 support, the\nelsize\nand\naligment\nfields must now be accessed via\nPyDataType_ELSIZE\n,\nPyDataType_SET_ELSIZE\n, and\nPyDataType_ALIGNMENT\n. In cases where the\ndescriptor is attached to an array, we advise using\nPyArray_ITEMSIZE\nas it exists on all NumPy versions. Please see\nmigration_c_descr\nfor more information.\n(\ngh-25943\n)\nNumPy 2.0 C API removals\nnpy_interrupt.h\nand the corresponding macros like\nNPY_SIGINT_ON\nhave been removed. We recommend querying\nPyErr_CheckSignals()\nor\nPyOS_InterruptOccurred()\nperiodically (these do currently require\nholding the GIL though).\nThe\nnoprefix.h\nheader has been removed. Replace missing symbols\nwith their prefixed counterparts (usually an added\nNPY_\nor\nnpy_\n).\n(\ngh-23919\n)\nPyUFunc_GetPyVals\n,\nPyUFunc_handlefperr\n, and\nPyUFunc_checkfperr\nhave been removed. If needed, a new backwards compatible function to\nraise floating point errors could be restored. Reason for removal:\nthere are no known users and the functions would have made\nwith np.errstate()\nfixes much more difficult).\n(\ngh-23922\n)\nThe\nnumpy/old_defines.h\nwhich was part of the API deprecated since\nNumPy 1.7 has been removed. This removes macros of the form\nPyArray_CONSTANT\n. The\nreplace_old_macros.sed\nscript may be useful to convert them to the\nNPY_CONSTANT\nversion.\n(\ngh-24011\n)\nThe\nlegacy_inner_loop_selector\nmember of the ufunc struct is\nremoved to simplify improvements to the dispatching system. There\nare no known users overriding or directly accessing this member.\n(\ngh-24271\n)\nNPY_INTPLTR\nhas been removed to avoid confusion (see\nintp\nredefinition).\n(\ngh-24888\n)\nThe advanced indexing\nMapIter\nand related API has been removed.\nThe (truly) public part of it was not well tested and had only one\nknown user (Theano). Making it private will simplify improvements to\nspeed up\nufunc.at\n, make advanced indexing more maintainable, and\nwas important for increasing the maximum number of dimensions of\narrays to 64. Please let us know if this API is important to you so\nwe can find a solution together.\n(\ngh-25138\n)\nThe\nNPY_MAX_ELSIZE\nmacro has been removed, as it only ever\nreflected builtin numeric types and served no internal purpose.\n(\ngh-25149\n)\nPyArray_REFCNT\nand\nNPY_REFCOUNT\nare removed. Use\nPy_REFCNT\ninstead.\n(\ngh-25156\n)\nPyArrayFlags_Type\nand\nPyArray_NewFlagsObject\nas well as\nPyArrayFlagsObject\nare private now. There is no known use-case;\nuse the Python API if needed.\nPyArray_MoveInto\n,\nPyArray_CastTo\n,\nPyArray_CastAnyTo\nare\nremoved use\nPyArray_CopyInto\nand if absolutely needed\nPyArray_CopyAnyInto\n(the latter does a flat copy).\nPyArray_FillObjectArray\nis removed, its only true use was for\nimplementing\nnp.empty\n. Create a new empty array or use\nPyArray_FillWithScalar()\n(decrefs existing objects).\nPyArray_CompareUCS4\nand\nPyArray_CompareString\nare removed. Use\nthe standard C string comparison functions.\nPyArray_ISPYTHON\nis removed as it is misleading, has no known\nuse-cases, and is easy to replace.\nPyArray_FieldNames\nis removed, as it is unclear what it would be\nuseful for. It also has incorrect semantics in some possible\nuse-cases.\nPyArray_TypestrConvert\nis removed, since it seems a misnomer and\nunlikely to be used by anyone. If you know the size or are limited\nto few types, just use it explicitly, otherwise go via Python\nstrings.\n(\ngh-25292\n)\nPyDataType_GetDatetimeMetaData\nis removed, it did not actually do\nanything since at least NumPy 1.7.\n(\ngh-25802\n)\nPyArray_GetCastFunc\nis removed. Note that custom legacy user\ndtypes can still provide a castfunc as their implementation, but any\naccess to them is now removed. The reason for this is that NumPy\nnever used these internally for many years. If you use simple\nnumeric types, please just use C casts directly. In case you require\nan alternative, please let us know so we can create new API such as\nPyArray_CastBuffer()\nwhich could use old or new cast functions\ndepending on the NumPy version.\n(\ngh-25161\n)\nNew Features\nnp.add\nwas extended to work with\nunicode\nand\nbytes\ndtypes.\n(\ngh-24858\n)\nA new\nbitwise_count\nfunction\nThis new function counts the number of 1-bits in a number.\nnumpy.bitwise_count\nworks on all the numpy integer types\nand integer-like objects.\n>\n>>\na\n=\nnp\n.\narray\n([\n2\n**\ni\n-\n1\nfor\ni\nin\nrange\n(\n16\n)])\n>\n>>\nnp\n.\nbitwise_count\n(\na\n)\narray\n([\n0\n,\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n,\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n,\n7\n,\n8\n,\n9\n,\n10\n,\n11\n,\n12\n,\n13\n,\n14\n,\n15\n],\ndtype\n=\nuint8\n)\n(\ngh-19355\n)\nmacOS Accelerate support, including the ILP64\nSupport for the updated Accelerate BLAS/LAPACK library, including ILP64\n(64-bit integer) support, in macOS 13.3 has been added. This brings\narm64 support, and significant performance improvements of up to 10x for\ncommonly used linear algebra operations. When Accelerate is selected at\nbuild time, or if no explicit BLAS library selection is done, the 13.3+\nversion will automatically be used if available.\n(\ngh-24053\n)\nBinary wheels are also available. On macOS >=14.0, users who install\nNumPy from PyPI will get wheels built against Accelerate rather than\nOpenBLAS.\n(\ngh-25255\n)\nOption to use weights for quantile and percentile functions\nA\nweights\nkeyword is now available for\nnumpy.quantile\n,\nnumpy.percentile\n,\nnumpy.nanquantile\nand\nnumpy.nanpercentile\n. Only\nmethod=\"inverted_cdf\"\nsupports weights.\n(\ngh-24254\n)\nImproved CPU optimization tracking\nA new tracer mechanism is available which enables tracking of the\nenabled targets for each optimized function (i.e., that uses\nhardware-specific SIMD instructions) in the NumPy library. With this\nenhancement, it becomes possible to precisely monitor the enabled CPU\ndispatch targets for the dispatched functions.\nA new function named\nopt_func_info\nhas been added to the new namespace\nnumpy.lib.introspect\n, offering this tracing capability.  This function allows\nyou to retrieve information about the enabled targets based on function names\nand data type signatures.\n(\ngh-24420\n)\nA new Meson backend for\nf2py\nf2py\nin compile mode (i.e.\nf2py -c\n) now accepts the\n--backend meson\noption. This is the default option for Python >=3.12.\nFor older Python versions,\nf2py\nwill still default to\n--backend distutils\n.\nTo support this in realistic use-cases, in compile mode\nf2py\ntakes a\n--dep\nflag one or many times which maps to\ndependency()\ncalls in the\nmeson\nbackend, and does nothing in the\ndistutils\nbackend.\nThere are no changes for users of\nf2py\nonly as a code generator, i.e.\nwithout\n-c\n.\n(\ngh-24532\n)\nbind(c)\nsupport for\nf2py\nBoth functions and subroutines can be annotated with\nbind(c)\n.\nf2py\nwill handle both the correct type mapping, and preserve the unique label\nfor other C interfaces.\nNote:\nbind(c, name = 'routine_name_other_than_fortran_routine')\nis\nnot honored by the\nf2py\nbindings by design, since\nbind(c)\nwith the\nname\nis meant to guarantee only the same name in C and Fortran, not in\nPython and Fortran.\n(\ngh-24555\n)\nA new\nstrict\noption for several testing functions\nThe\nstrict\nkeyword is now available for\nnumpy.testing.assert_allclose\n,\nnumpy.testing.assert_equal\n, and\nnumpy.testing.assert_array_less\n. Setting\nstrict=True\nwill disable the broadcasting behaviour for scalars and ensure\nthat input arrays have the same data type.\n(\ngh-24680\n,\ngh-24770\n,\ngh-24775\n)\nAdd\nnp.core.umath.find\nand\nnp.core.umath.rfind\nUFuncs\nAdd two\nfind\nand\nrfind\nUFuncs that operate on unicode or byte\nstrings and are used in\nnp.char\n. They operate similar to\nstr.find\nand\nstr.rfind\n.\n(\ngh-24868\n)\ndiagonal\nand\ntrace\nfor\nnumpy.linalg\nnumpy.linalg.diagonal\nand\nnumpy.linalg.trace\nhave been added, which are\narray API standard-compatible variants of\nnumpy.diagonal\nand\nnumpy.trace\n.\nThey differ in the default axis selection which define 2-D sub-arrays.\n(\ngh-24887\n)\nNew\nlong\nand\nulong\ndtypes\nnumpy.long\nand\nnumpy.ulong\nhave been added as NumPy integers mapping to\nC's\nlong\nand\nunsigned long\n. Prior to NumPy 1.24,\nnumpy.long\nwas an alias\nto Python's\nint\n.\n(\ngh-24922\n)\nsvdvals\nfor\nnumpy.linalg\nnumpy.linalg.svdvals\nhas been added. It computes singular values for (a stack\nof) matrices. Executing\nnp.svdvals(x)\nis the same as calling\nnp.svd(x, compute_uv=False, hermitian=False)\n. This function is compatible with the array\nAPI standard.\n(\ngh-24940\n)\nA new\nisdtype\nfunction\nnumpy.isdtype\nwas added to provide a canonical way to classify NumPy's\ndtypes in compliance with the array API standard.\n(\ngh-25054\n)\nA new\nastype\nfunction\nnumpy.astype\nwas added to provide an array API standard-compatible\nalternative to the\nnumpy.ndarray.astype\nmethod.\n(\ngh-25079\n)\nArray API compatible functions' aliases\n13 aliases for existing functions were added to improve compatibility\nwith the array API standard:\nTrigonometry:\nacos\n,\nacosh\n,\nasin\n,\nasinh\n,\natan\n,\natanh\n,\natan2\n.\nBitwise:\nbitwise_left_shift\n,\nbitwise_invert\n,\nbitwise_right_shift\n.\nMisc:\nconcat\n,\npermute_dims\n,\npow\n.\nIn\nnumpy.linalg\n:\ntensordot\n,\nmatmul\n.\n(\ngh-25086\n)\nNew\nunique_*\nfunctions\nThe\nnumpy.unique_all\n,\nnumpy.unique_counts\n,\nnumpy.unique_inverse\n, and\nnumpy.unique_values\nfunctions have been added. They provide functionality of\nnumpy.unique\nwith different sets of flags. They are array API\nstandard-compatible, and because the number of arrays they return does not\ndepend on the values of input arguments, they are easier to target for JIT\ncompilation.\n(\ngh-25088\n)\nMatrix transpose support for ndarrays\nNumPy now offers support for calculating the matrix transpose of an\narray (or stack of arrays). The matrix transpose is equivalent to\nswapping the last two axes of an array. Both\nnp.ndarray\nand\nnp.ma.MaskedArray\nnow expose a\n.mT\nattribute, and there is a\nmatching new\nnumpy.matrix_transpose\nfunction.\n(\ngh-23762\n)\nArray API compatible functions for\nnumpy.linalg\nSix new functions and two aliases were added to improve compatibility\nwith the Array API standard for `numpy.linalg`:\nnumpy.linalg.matrix_norm\n- Computes the matrix norm of\na matrix (or a stack of matrices).\nnumpy.linalg.vector_norm\n- Computes the vector norm of\na vector (or batch of vectors).\nnumpy.vecdot\n- Computes the (vector) dot product of\ntwo arrays.\nnumpy.linalg.vecdot\n- An alias for\nnumpy.vecdot\n.\nnumpy.linalg.matrix_transpose\n- An alias for\nnumpy.matrix_transpose\n.\n(\ngh-25155\n)\nnumpy.linalg.outer\nhas been added. It computes the\nouter product of two vectors. It differs from\nnumpy.outer\nby accepting one-dimensional arrays only.\nThis function is compatible with the array API standard.\n(\ngh-25101\n)\nnumpy.linalg.cross\nhas been added. It computes the\ncross product of two (arrays of) 3-dimensional vectors. It differs\nfrom\nnumpy.cross\nby accepting three-dimensional\nvectors only. This function is compatible with the array API\nstandard.\n(\ngh-25145\n)\nA\ncorrection\nargument for\nvar\nand\nstd\nA\ncorrection\nargument was added to\nnumpy.var\nand\nnumpy.std\n, which is an\narray API standard compatible alternative to\nddof\n. As both arguments serve a\nsimilar purpose, only one of them can be provided at the same time.\n(\ngh-25169\n)\nndarray.device\nand\nndarray.to_device\nAn\nndarray.device\nattribute and\nndarray.to_device\nmethod were added\nto\nnumpy.ndarray\nfor array API standard compatibility.\nAdditionally,\ndevice\nkeyword-only arguments were added to:\nnumpy.asarray\n,\nnumpy.arange\n,\nnumpy.empty\n,\nnumpy.empty_like\n,\nnumpy.eye\n,\nnumpy.full\n,\nnumpy.full_like\n,\nnumpy.linspace\n,\nnumpy.ones\n,\nnumpy.ones_like\n,\nnumpy.zeros\n, and\nnumpy.zeros_like\n.\nFor all these new arguments, only\ndevice=\"cpu\"\nis supported.\n(\ngh-25233\n)\nStringDType has been added to NumPy\nWe have added a new variable-width UTF-8 encoded string data type, implementing\na \"NumPy array of Python strings\", including support for a user-provided\nmissing data sentinel. It is intended as a drop-in replacement for arrays of\nPython strings and missing data sentinels using the object dtype. See\nNEP 55\nand the documentation\nof stringdtype for more details.\n(\ngh-25347\n)\nNew keywords for\ncholesky\nand\npinv\nThe\nupper\nand\nrtol\nkeywords were added to\nnumpy.linalg.cholesky\nand\nnumpy.linalg.pinv\n,\nrespectively, to improve array API standard compatibility.\nFor\nnumpy.linalg.pinv\n, if neither\nrcond\nnor\nrtol\nis\nspecified, the\nrcond\n's default is used. We plan to deprecate and\nremove\nrcond\nin the future.\n(\ngh-25388\n)\nNew keywords for\nsort\n,\nargsort\nand\nlinalg.matrix_rank\nNew keyword parameters were added to improve array API standard\ncompatibility:\nrtol\nwas added to\nnumpy.linalg.matrix_rank\n.\nstable\nwas added to\nnumpy.sort\nand\nnumpy.argsort\n.\n(\ngh-25437\n)\nNew\nnumpy.strings\nnamespace for string ufuncs\nNumPy now implements some string operations as ufuncs. The old\nnp.char\nnamespace is still available, and where possible the string manipulation\nfunctions in that namespace have been updated to use the new ufuncs,\nsubstantially improving their performance.\nWhere possible, we suggest updating code to use functions in\nnp.strings\ninstead of\nnp.char\n. In the future we may deprecate\nnp.char\nin favor of\nnp.strings\n.\n(\ngh-25463\n)\nnumpy.fft\nsupport for different precisions and in-place calculations\nThe various FFT routines in\nnumpy.fft\nnow do their\ncalculations natively in float, double, or long double precision,\ndepending on the input precision, instead of always calculating in\ndouble precision. Hence, the calculation will now be less precise for\nsingle and more precise for long double precision. The data type of the\noutput array will now be adjusted accordingly.\nFurthermore, all FFT routines have gained an\nout\nargument that can be\nused for in-place calculations.\n(\ngh-25536\n)\nconfigtool and pkg-config support\nA new\nnumpy-config\nCLI script is available that can be queried for the\nNumPy version and for compile flags needed to use the NumPy C API. This\nwill allow build systems to better support the use of NumPy as a\ndependency. Also, a\nnumpy.pc\npkg-config file is now included with\nNumpy. In order to find its location for use with\nPKG_CONFIG_PATH\n, use\nnumpy-config --pkgconfigdir\n.\n(\ngh-25730\n)\nArray API standard support in the main namespace\nThe main\nnumpy\nnamespace now supports the array API standard. See\narray-api-standard-compatibility\nfor\ndetails.\n(\ngh-25911\n)\nImprovements\nStrings are now supported by\nany\n,\nall\n, and the logical ufuncs.\n(\ngh-25651\n)\nInteger sequences as the shape argument for\nmemmap\nnumpy.memmap\ncan now be created with any integer sequence\nas the\nshape\nargument, such as a list or numpy array of integers.\nPreviously, only the types of tuple and int could be used without\nraising an error.\n(\ngh-23729\n)\nerrstate\nis now faster and context safe\nThe\nnumpy.errstate\ncontext manager/decorator is now faster\nand safer. Previously, it was not context safe and had (rare) issues\nwith thread-safety.\n(\ngh-23936\n)\nAArch64 quicksort speed improved by using Highway's VQSort\nThe first introduction of the Google Highway library, using VQSort on\nAArch64. Execution time is improved by up to 16x in some cases, see the\nPR for benchmark results. Extensions to other platforms will be done in\nthe future.\n(\ngh-24018\n)\nComplex types - underlying C type changes\nThe underlying C types for all of NumPy's complex types have been\nchanged to use C99 complex types.\nWhile this change does not affect the memory layout of complex\ntypes, it changes the API to be used to directly retrieve or write\nthe real or complex part of the complex number, since direct field\naccess (as in\nc.real\nor\nc.imag\n) is no longer an option. You can\nnow use utilities provided in\nnumpy/npy_math.h\nto do these\noperations, like this:\nnpy_cdouble\nc\n;\nnpy_csetreal\n(\n&\nc\n,\n1.0\n);\nnpy_csetimag\n(\n&\nc\n,\n0.0\n);\nprintf\n(\n\"%d + %di\\n\"\n,\nnpy_creal\n(\nc\n),\nnpy_cimag\n(\nc\n));\nTo ease cross-version compatibility, equivalent macros and a\ncompatibility layer have been added which can be used by downstream\npackages to continue to support both NumPy 1.x and 2.x. See\ncomplex-numbers\nfor more info.\nnumpy/npy_common.h\nnow includes\ncomplex.h\n, which means that\ncomplex\nis now a reserved keyword.\n(\ngh-24085\n)\niso_c_binding\nsupport and improved common blocks for\nf2py\nPreviously, users would have to define their own custom\nf2cmap\nfile to\nuse type mappings defined by the Fortran2003\niso_c_binding\nintrinsic\nmodule. These type maps are now natively supported by\nf2py\n(\ngh-24555\n)\nf2py\nnow handles\ncommon\nblocks which have\nkind\nspecifications from\nmodules. This further expands the usability of intrinsics like\niso_fortran_env\nand\niso_c_binding\n.\n(\ngh-25186\n)\nCall\nstr\nautomatically on third argument to functions like\nassert_equal\nThe third argument to functions like\nnumpy.testing.assert_equal\nnow has\nstr\ncalled on it\nautomatically. This way it mimics the built-in\nassert\nstatement, where\nassert_equal(a, b, obj)\nworks like\nassert a == b, obj\n.\n(\ngh-24877\n)\nSupport for array-like\natol\n/\nrtol\nin\nisclose\n,\nallclose\nThe keywords\natol\nand\nrtol\nin\nnumpy.isclose\nand\nnumpy.allclose\nnow accept both scalars and arrays. An\narray, if given, must broadcast to the shapes of the first two array\narguments.\n(\ngh-24878\n)\nConsistent failure messages in test functions\nPreviously, some\nnumpy.testing\nassertions printed messages\nthat referred to the actual and desired results as\nx\nand\ny\n. Now,\nthese values are consistently referred to as\nACTUAL\nand\nDESIRED\n.\n(\ngh-24931\n)\nn-D FFT transforms allow\ns[i] == -1\nThe\nnumpy.fft.fftn\n,\nnumpy.fft.ifftn\n,\nnumpy.fft.rfftn\n,\nnumpy.fft.irfftn\n,\nnumpy.fft.fft2\n,\nnumpy.fft.ifft2\n,\nnumpy.fft.rfft2\nand\nnumpy.fft.irfft2\nfunctions now use the whole input array along the axis\ni\nif\ns[i] == -1\n, in line with the array API standard.\n(\ngh-25495\n)\nGuard PyArrayScalar_VAL and PyUnicodeScalarObject for the limited API\nPyUnicodeScalarObject\nholds a\nPyUnicodeObject\n, which is not\navailable when using\nPy_LIMITED_API\n. Add guards to hide it and\nconsequently also make the\nPyArrayScalar_VAL\nmacro hidden.\n(\ngh-25531\n)\nChanges\nnp.gradient()\nnow returns a tuple rather than a list making the\nreturn value immutable.\n(\ngh-23861\n)\nBeing fully context and thread-safe,\nnp.errstate\ncan only be\nentered once now.\nnp.setbufsize\nis now tied to\nnp.errstate()\n: leaving an\nnp.errstate\ncontext will also reset the\nbufsize\n.\n(\ngh-23936\n)\nA new public\nnp.lib.array_utils\nsubmodule has been introduced and\nit currently contains three functions:\nbyte_bounds\n(moved from\nnp.lib.utils\n),\nnormalize_axis_tuple\nand\nnormalize_axis_index\n.\n(\ngh-24540\n)\nIntroduce\nnumpy.bool\nas the new canonical name for\nNumPy's boolean dtype, and make\nnumpy.bool\\_\nan alias\nto it. Note that until NumPy 1.24,\nnp.bool\nwas an alias to\nPython's builtin\nbool\n. The new name helps with array API standard\ncompatibility and is a more intuitive name.\n(\ngh-25080\n)\nThe\ndtype.flags\nvalue was previously stored as a signed integer.\nThis means that the aligned dtype struct flag lead to negative flags\nbeing set (-128 rather than 128). This flag is now stored unsigned\n(positive). Code which checks flags manually may need to adapt. This\nmay include code compiled with Cython 0.29.x.\n(\ngh-25816\n)\nRepresentation of NumPy scalars changed\nAs per NEP 51, the scalar representation has been updated to include the type\ninformation to avoid confusion with Python scalars.\nScalars are now printed as\nnp.float64(3.0)\nrather than just\n3.0\n.\nThis may disrupt workflows that store representations of numbers (e.g.,\nto files) making it harder to read them. They should be stored as\nexplicit strings, for example by using\nstr()\nor\nf\"{scalar!s}\"\n. For\nthe time being, affected users can use\nnp.set_printoptions(legacy=\"1.25\")\nto get the old behavior (with\npossibly a few exceptions). Documentation of downstream projects may\nrequire larger updates, if code snippets are tested. We are working on\ntooling for\ndoctest-plus\nto facilitate updates.\n(\ngh-22449\n)\nTruthiness of NumPy strings changed\nNumPy strings previously were inconsistent about how they defined if the\nstring is\nTrue\nor\nFalse\nand the definition did not match the one\nused by Python. Strings are now considered\nTrue\nwhen they are\nnon-empty and\nFalse\nwhen they are empty. This changes the following\ndistinct cases:\nCasts from string to boolean were previously roughly equivalent to\nstring_array.astype(np.int64).astype(bool)\n, meaning that only\nvalid integers could be cast. Now a string of\n\"0\"\nwill be\nconsidered\nTrue\nsince it is not empty. If you need the old\nbehavior, you may use the above step (casting to integer first) or\nstring_array == \"0\"\n(if the input is only ever\n0\nor\n1\n). To get\nthe new result on old NumPy versions use\nstring_array != \"\"\n.\nnp.nonzero(string_array)\npreviously ignored whitespace so that a\nstring only containing whitespace was considered\nFalse\n. Whitespace\nis now considered\nTrue\n.\nThis change does not affect\nnp.loadtxt\n,\nnp.fromstring\n, or\nnp.genfromtxt\n. The first two still use the integer definition, while\ngenfromtxt\ncontinues to match for\n\"true\"\n(ignoring case). However,\nif\nnp.bool_\nis used as a converter the result will change.\nThe change does affect\nnp.fromregex\nas it uses direct assignments.\n(\ngh-23871\n)\nA\nmean\nkeyword was added to var and std function\nOften when the standard deviation is needed the mean is also needed. The\nsame holds for the variance and the mean. Until now the mean is then\ncalculated twice, the change introduced here for the\nnumpy.var\nand\nnumpy.std\nfunctions allows for passing in a precalculated mean as an keyword\nargument. See the docstrings for details and an example illustrating the\nspeed-up.\n(\ngh-24126\n)\nRemove datetime64 deprecation warning when constructing with timezone\nThe\nnumpy.datetime64\nmethod now issues a UserWarning rather than a\nDeprecationWarning whenever a timezone is included in the datetime string that\nis provided.\n(\ngh-24193\n)\nDefault integer dtype is now 64-bit on 64-bit Windows\nThe default NumPy integer is now 64-bit on all 64-bit systems as the\nhistoric 32-bit default on Windows was a common source of issues. Most\nusers should not notice this. The main issues may occur with code\ninterfacing with libraries written in a compiled language like C. For\nmore information see\nmigration_windows_int64\n.\n(\ngh-24224\n)\nRenamed\nnumpy.core\nto\nnumpy._core\nAccessing\nnumpy.core\nnow emits a DeprecationWarning. In practice we\nhave found that most downstream usage of\nnumpy.core\nwas to access\nfunctionality that is available in the main\nnumpy\nnamespace. If for\nsome reason you are using functionality in\nnumpy.core\nthat is not\navailable in the main\nnumpy\nnamespace, this means you are likely using\nprivate NumPy internals. You can still access these internals via\nnumpy._core\nwithout a deprecation warning but we do not provide any\nbackward compatibility guarantees for NumPy internals. Please open an\nissue if you think a mistake was made and something needs to be made\npublic.\n(\ngh-24634\n)\nThe \"relaxed strides\" debug build option, which was previously enabled\nthrough the\nNPY_RELAXED_STRIDES_DEBUG\nenvironment variable or the\n-Drelaxed-strides-debug\nconfig-settings flag has been removed.\n(\ngh-24717\n)\nRedefinition of\nnp.intp\n/\nnp.uintp\n(almost never a change)\nDue to the actual use of these types almost always matching the use of\nsize_t\n/\nPy_ssize_t\nthis is now the definition in C. Previously, it\nmatched\nintptr_t\nand\nuintptr_t\nwhich would often have been subtly\nincorrect. This has no effect on the vast majority of machines since the\nsize of these types only differ on extremely niche platforms.\nHowever, it means that:\nPointers may not necessarily fit into an\nintp\ntyped array anymore.\nThe\np\nand\nP\ncharacter codes can still be used, however.\nCreating\nintptr_t\nor\nuintptr_t\ntyped arrays in C remains\npossible in a cross-platform way via\nPyArray_DescrFromType('p')\n.\nThe new character codes\nnN\nwere introduced.\nIt is now correct to use the Python C-API functions when parsing to\nnpy_intp\ntyped arguments.\n(\ngh-24888\n)\nnumpy.fft.helper\nmade private\nnumpy.fft.helper\nwas renamed to\nnumpy.fft._helper\nto indicate that\nit is a private submodule. All public functions exported by it should be\naccessed from\nnumpy.fft\n.\n(\ngh-24945\n)\nnumpy.linalg.linalg\nmade private\nnumpy.linalg.linalg\nwas renamed to\nnumpy.linalg._linalg\nto indicate\nthat it is a private submodule. All public functions exported by it\nshould be accessed from\nnumpy.linalg\n.\n(\ngh-24946\n)\nOut-of-bound axis not the same as\naxis=None\nIn some cases\naxis=32\nor for concatenate any large value was the same\nas\naxis=None\n. Except for\nconcatenate\nthis was deprecate. Any out of\nbound axis value will now error, make sure to use\naxis=None\n.\n(\ngh-25149\n)\nNew\ncopy\nkeyword meaning for\narray\nand\nasarray\nconstructors\nNow\nnumpy.array\nand\nnumpy.asarray\nsupport\nthree values for\ncopy\nparameter:\nNone\n- A copy will only be made if it is necessary.\nTrue\n- Always make a copy.\nFalse\n- Never make a copy. If a copy is required a\nValueError\nis\nraised.\nThe meaning of\nFalse\nchanged as it now raises an exception if a copy\nis needed.\n(\ngh-25168\n)\nThe\n__array__\nspecial method now takes a\ncopy\nkeyword argument.\nNumPy will pass\ncopy\nto the\n__array__\nspecial method in situations\nwhere it would be set to a non-default value (e.g. in a call to\nnp.asarray(some_object, copy=False)\n). Currently, if an unexpected\nkeyword argument error is raised after this, NumPy will print a warning\nand re-try without the\ncopy\nkeyword argument. Implementations of\nobjects implementing the\n__array__\nprotocol should accept a\ncopy\nkeyword argument with the same meaning as when passed to\nnumpy.array\nor\nnumpy.asarray\n.\n(\ngh-25168\n)\nCleanup of initialization of\nnumpy.dtype\nwith strings with commas\nThe interpretation of strings with commas is changed slightly, in that a\ntrailing comma will now always create a structured dtype. E.g., where\npreviously\nnp.dtype(\"i\")\nand\nnp.dtype(\"i,\")\nwere treated as\nidentical, now\nnp.dtype(\"i,\")\nwill create a structured dtype, with a\nsingle field. This is analogous to\nnp.dtype(\"i,i\")\ncreating a\nstructured dtype with two fields, and makes the behaviour consistent\nwith that expected of tuples.\nAt the same time, the use of single number surrounded by parenthesis to\nindicate a sub-array shape, like in\nnp.dtype(\"(2)i,\")\n, is deprecated.\nInstead; one should use\nnp.dtype(\"(2,)i\")\nor\nnp.dtype(\"2i\")\n.\nEventually, using a number in parentheses will raise an exception, like\nis the case for initializations without a comma, like\nnp.dtype(\"(2)i\")\n.\n(\ngh-25434\n)\nChange in how complex sign is calculated\nFollowing the array API standard, the complex sign is now calculated as\nz / |z|\n(instead of the rather less logical case where the sign of the\nreal part was taken, unless the real part was zero, in which case the\nsign of the imaginary part was returned). Like for real numbers, zero is\nreturned if\nz==0\n.\n(\ngh-25441\n)\nReturn types of functions that returned a list of arrays\nFunctions that returned a list of ndarrays have been changed to return a\ntuple of ndarrays instead. Returning tuples consistently whenever a\nsequence of arrays is returned makes it easier for JIT compilers like\nNumba, as well as for static type checkers in some cases, to support\nthese functions. Changed functions are:\nnumpy.atleast_1d\n,\nnumpy.atleast_2d\n,\nnumpy.atleast_3d\n,\nnumpy.broadcast_arrays\n,\nnumpy.meshgrid\n,\nnumpy.ogrid\n,\nnumpy.histogramdd\n.\nnp.unique\nreturn_inverse\nshape for multi-dimensional inputs\nWhen multi-dimensional inputs are passed to\nnp.unique\nwith\nreturn_inverse=True\n, the\nunique_inverse\noutput is now shaped such\nthat the input can be reconstructed directly using\nnp.take(unique, unique_inverse)\nwhen\naxis=None\n, and\nnp.take_along_axis(unique, unique_inverse, axis=axis)\notherwise.\n(\ngh-25553\n,\ngh-25570\n)\nany\nand\nall\nreturn booleans for object arrays\nThe\nany\nand\nall\nfunctions and methods now return booleans also for\nobject arrays. Previously, they did a reduction which behaved like the\nPython\nor\nand\nand\noperators which evaluates to one of the arguments.\nYou can use\nnp.logical_or.reduce\nand\nnp.logical_and.reduce\nto\nachieve the previous behavior.\n(\ngh-25712\n)\nnp.can_cast\ncannot be called on Python int, float, or complex\nnp.can_cast\ncannot be called with Python int, float, or complex\ninstances anymore. This is because NEP 50 means that the result of\ncan_cast\nmust not depend on the value passed in. Unfortunately, for\nPython scalars whether a cast should be considered\n\"same_kind\"\nor\n\"safe\"\nmay depend on the context and value so that this is currently\nnot implemented. In some cases, this means you may have to add a\nspecific path for:\nif type(obj) in (int, float, complex): ...\n.\n(\ngh-26393\n)\nChecksums\nMD5\nfcda027f9735771088e607161c913094

Below are the full release notes for this release.\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\nMin supported Python version is now 3.10 (\n#162310\n)\nThe minimum version of Python required for PyTorch 2.9.0 is 3.10. We also have 3.14 and 3.14t available as preview with this release.\nUndefined behavior when an output of a custom operator shares storage with an input\nThis is a reminder that outputs of PyTorch custom operators (that are registered using the\ntorch.library\nor\nTORCH_LIBRARY\nAPIs) are not allowed to return Tensors that share storage with input tensors. The violation of this condition leads to undefined behavior: sometimes the result will be correct, sometimes it will be garbage.\nAfter\n#163227\n, custom operators that violated this condition that previously returned correct results under\ntorch.compile\nmay now return silently incorrect results under\ntorch.compile\n. Because this is changing the behavior of undefined behavior, we do not consider this to be a bug, but we are still documenting it in this section as a \"potentially unexpected behavior change\".\nThis is one of the conditions checked for by\ntorch.library.opcheck\nand is mentioned in\nThe Custom Operators Manual\nMore details\nOutputs of PyTorch custom operators are not allowed to return Tensors that share storage with input tensors\nFor example, the following two custom operators are not valid custom operators:\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::foo\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n())\ndef\nfoo\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\n# the result of `foo` must not directly be an input to foo.\nreturn\nx\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::bar\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n())\ndef\nbar\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\n# the result of bar must not be a view of an input of bar\nreturn\nx\n.\nview\n(\n-\n1\n)\nThe easiest workaround is to add an extra\n.clone()\nto the outputs:\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::foo\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n())\ndef\nfoo\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\nreturn\nx\n.\nclone\n()\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::bar\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n())\ndef\nbar\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\nreturn\nx\n.\nview\n(\n-\n1\n).\nclone\n()\nA common way to get into this situation is for a user to want to create a custom operator that sometimes mutates the input in-place and sometimes returns a new Tensor, like in the following example.\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::baz\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n[\n\"x\"\n])\ndef\nbaz\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\nif\ninplace\n:\nx\n.\nsin_\n()\nreturn\nx\nelse\n:\nreturn\nx\n.\nsin\n()\nThis dynamism is not supported and leads to undefined behavior. The workaround is to split the custom operator into two custom operators, one that always mutates the input in-place, and another that always returns a new Tensor.\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::baz_outplace\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n())\ndef\nbaz_outplace\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\nreturn\nx\n.\nsin\n()\n@\ntorch\n.\nlibrary\n.\ncustom_op\n(\n\"mylib::baz_inplace\"\n,\nmutates_args\n=\n[\n\"x\"\n])\ndef\nbaz_inplace\n(\nx\n:\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n)\n->\ntorch\n.\nTensor\n:\nx\n.\nsin_\n()\ndef\nbaz\n(\nx\n):\nif\ninplace\n:\nbaz_inplace\n(\nx\n)\nreturn\nx\nelse\n:\nreturn\nbaz_outplace\n(\nx\n)\nBuild metal kernels of MacOS-14+ and remove all pre-MacOS-14 specific logic, requires MacOS-14+ going forward (\n#159733\n,\n#159912\n)\nPyTorch MPS is only supported on MacOS-14 or later. If you need to use MPS on MacOS Ventura, please avoid updating to Python-3.9 or above\nUpgrade to DLPack 1.0 (\n#145000\n)\nThis upgrade is doing the same BC-breaking changes as the DLPack release. Objects in\ntorch.utils.dlpack\nhave been updated to reflect these changes, such as\nDLDeviceType\n.\nSee the PR for details on the exact changes and how to update your code.\nRaise appropriate errors in\ntorch.cat\n(\n#158249\n)\ntorch.cat\nnow raises\nValueError\n,\nIndexError\nor\nTypeError\nwhere appropriate instead of the generic\nRuntimeError\n. If you code was catching these errors, you can update to catch the new error type.\nDefault to\ndynamo=True\nfor ONNX exporter (\n#159646\n,\n#162726\n)\nPreviously\ntorch.onnx.export(...)\nused the legacy TorchScript exporter if no arguments were provied. The ONNX exporter now uses the newer\ntorch.export.export\npipeline by default (\ndynamo=True\n). This change improves graph fidelity and future-proofs exports, but may surface graph capture errors that were previously masked or handled differently.\nPreviously in torch 2.8.0:\n# API calls the legacy exporter with dynamo=False\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...)\nNow in torch 2.9.0:\n# To preserve the original behavior\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...,\ndynamo\n=\nFalse\n)\n# Export onnx model through torch.export.export\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...)\nRecommendation: first try the new default; only fall back if you hit blocking issues and report them upstream.\nLong term solution: fix the root cause instead of relying on fallback or TorchScript exporter.\nSwitch off runtime asserts by default in Export in favor of a shape guards function (\n#160111\n,\n#161178\n,\n#161794\n)\nTo enable runtime asserts, use\nexport(..., prefer_deferred_runtime_asserts_over_guards=True)\n. Also kills the\nallow_complex_guards_as_runtime_asserts\nflag, merging it into the former option.\nAdditionally,\nexported_program.module()\nwill generate a call to a\n_guards_fn\nsubmodule that will run additional checks on inputs. Users who do not want this behavior can either remove this call in the graph, or do\nexported_program.module(check_guards=False)\nto avoid the generation.\nSet default opset to 20 in ONNX (\n#158802\n)\nOpset 20 enables newer operator definitions. If your tooling or downstream runtime only supports opset 18, pin it explicitly. For the latest ONNX operators, you can experiment with opset 23.\nPreviously in torch 2.8.0:\n# opset_version=18\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...)\nNow in torch 2.9.0:\n# To preserve the original behavior\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...,\nopset_version\n=\n18\n)\n# New: opset_version=20\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...)\n# Use the latest supported opset: opset_version=23\ntorch\n.\nonnx\n.\nexport\n(...,\nopset_version\n=\n23\n)\nDrop\ndraft_export\nin exporter API (\n#161454\n,\n#162225\n)\nRemove implicit draft tracing from the default exporter path, achieving clearer behaviour and faster failures.\nThe expensive\ntorch.export.draft_export\ndiagnostic path is no longer auto-invoked (which could take hours on large models). You can still opt in for deep diagnostics:\nPreviously in torch 2.8.0:\n#\nIf both torch.export.export(..., strict=False) and\n#\ntorch.export.export(..., strict=True) fail to capture\n#\nthe model graph, torch.export.draft_export(...) will be triggered,\n#\nand uses real tensor to trace/export the model.\n#\n#\nInside export_to_onnx.py:\n#\n... torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)\npython export_to_onnx.py\nNow in torch 2.9.0:\n#\nTo trigger torch.export.draft_export once\n#\ntorch.export.export strict=False/True both\n#\nfail:\nTORCH_ONNX_ENABLE_DRAFT_EXPORT=True python export_to_onnx.py\nRemove\ntorch.onnx.dynamo_export\nand the\nonnxrt\ntorch compile backend (\n#158130\n,\n#158258\n)\ntorch.onnx.dynamo_export\nis removed. Please use\ntorch.onnx.export\ninstead.\nThe experimental ONNX Runtime compile backend (\ntorch.compile(backend=\"onnxrt\")\n) is no longer supported.\nRemove\ntorch.onnx.enable_fake_mode\n(\n#161222\n)\nThe\ndynamo=True\nmode uses\nFakeTensor\ns by default which is memory efficient.\nSome public facing ONNX utility APIs for the TorchScript based exporter are now private (\n#161323\n)\nDeprecated members in\ntorch.onnx.verification\nare removed. Previously private\ntorch.onnx.symbolic_opsets*\nfunctions will no longer be accessible. Consider making a copy of the source code if you need to access any private functions for compatibility with the TorchScript based exporter.\nRemove\ntorch.onnx.symbolic_caffe2\n(\n#157102\n)\nSupport for\ncaffe2\nin the ONNX exporter has ended and is removed.\nRemove\n/d2implyavx512upperregs\nflag that slows build (\n#159431\n)\nRe-introduced AVX512 optimizations for Windows VS2022 builds, may cause issues with specific versions of VS2022, see\n#145702\nAdd\nScalarType\nto shim conversion and\nstable::Tensor.scalar_type\n(\n#160557\n)\nBefore, user extensions could only in abstract pass around obfuscated dtypes appearing as\nint32_ts\n. Now, users can confidently use\ntorch::headeronly::ScalarType\nin their extensions for major scalar types. This PR enables ABI stability by adding a translation layer through the shim, so that even if the\nScalarType\nenum values change in the future, user extensions need not fear.\nThis change adds ScalarType support for user extensions and is only narrowly BC breaking for unpopular dtypes:\nquint*\ns,\nqint*\ns,\nBits*\n,\ndummy_uint*\ns,\ndummy_int*\ns,\nFloat8_e8m0fnu\n, and\nFloat4_e2m1fn_x2\nin the use case where an extension retrieves a Tensor dtype of the above and passes it into\naoti_torch_call_dispatcher\n.\nDeprecations\nDeprecate\npin_memory_device\nparam in\ntorch.utils.data.DataLoader\n(\n#158323\n)\nWe move enabling\npin_memory\nback inside\nBaseDataLoaderIter\n.

As well, a new default TCPStore server backend utilizing\nlibuv\nhas been introduced\nwhich should significantly reduce initialization times for users running large-scale jobs.\nFinally, a new Python Custom Operator API makes it easier than before to integrate custom kernels\ninto PyTorch, especially for\ntorch.compile\n.\nThis release is composed of 3661 commits and 475 contributors since PyTorch 2.3. We want to sincerely thank our\ndedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we\nimprove 2.4.

The issue will be fixed (\n#131194\n) in v2.4.1. It can be solved locally by setting the environment variable\nTORCHINDUCTOR_WORKER_START=fork\nbefore executing the script.\ncu118 wheels will not work with pre-cuda12 drivers\nIt was also reported (\n#130684\n) that the new version of triton uses cuda features that are not compatible with pre-cuda12 drivers.\nIn this case, the\nworkaround\nis to set\nTRITON_PTXAS_PATH\nmanually as follows (adapt the code according to the local installation path):\nTRITON_PTXAS_PATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/bin/ptxas  python script.py\nBackwards Incompatible Change\nPython frontend\nDefault\nTreadPool\nsize to number of physical cores  (\n#125963\n)\nChanged the default number of threads used for intra-op parallelism from the number of logical cores to the number of\nphysical cores. This should reduce core oversubscribing when running CPU workload and improve performance.\nPrevious behavior can be recovered by using torch.set_num_threads to set the number of threads to the desired value.\nFix\ntorch.quasirandom.SobolEngine.draw\ndefault dtype handling (\n#126781\n)\nThe default dtype value has been changed from\ntorch.float32\nto the current default dtype as given by\ntorch.get_default_dtype()\nto be consistent with other APIs.\nForbid subclassing\ntorch._C._TensorBase\ndirectly (\n#125558\n)\nThis is an internal subclass that a user used to be able to create an object that is almost a Tensor in Python and was\nadvertised as such in some tutorials. This is not allowed anymore to improve consistency and all users should\nsubclass torch.Tensor directly.\nComposability\nNon-compositional usages of as_strided + mutation under\ntorch.compile\nwill raise an error (\n#122502\n)\nThe\ntorch.compile\nflow involves functionalizing any mutations inside the region being compiled. Torch.as_strided is\nan existing view op that can be used non-compositionally: meaning when you call x.as_strided(...), as_strided will only\nconsider the underlying storage size of x, and ignore its current size/stride/storage_offset when creating a new view.\nThis makes it difficult to safely functionalize mutations on views of as_strided that are created non-compositionally,\nso we ban them rather than risking silent correctness issues under torch.compile.\nAn example of a non-compositional usage of as_strided followed by mutation that we will error on is below. You can avoid\nthis issue by re-writing your usage of as_strided so that it is compositional (for example: either use a different set\nof view ops instead of as_strided, or call as_strided directly on the base tensor instead of an existing view of it).\n@\ntorch\n.\ncompile\ndef\nfoo\n(\na\n):\ne\n=\na\n.\ndiagonal\n()\n# as_strided is being called on an existing view (e),\n# making it non-compositional. mutations to f under torch.compile\n# are not allowed, as we cannot easily functionalize them safely\nf\n=\ne\n.\nas_strided\n((\n2\n,), (\n1\n,),\n0\n)\nf\n.\nadd_\n(\n1.0\n)\nreturn\na\nWe now verify schemas of custom ops at registration time (\n#124520\n)\nPreviously, you could register a custom op through the operator registration APIs, but give it a schema that contained\ntypes unknown to the PyTorch Dispatcher. This behavior came from TorchScript, where “unknown” types were implicitly\ntreated by the TorchScript interpreter as type variables.

    "content": "PyTorch 2.0 Release notes\nHighlights\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\nDeprecations\nNew Features\nImprovements\nBug fixes\nPerformance\nDocumentation\nHighlights\nWe are excited to announce the release of PyTorch® 2.0 (\nrelease note\n) which we highlighted during the\nPyTorch Conference\non 12/2/22! PyTorch 2.0 offers the same eager-mode development and user experience, while fundamentally changing and supercharging how PyTorch operates at compiler level under the hood with faster performance and support for Dynamic Shapes and Distributed.\nThis next-generation release includes a Stable version of Accelerated Transformers (formerly called Better Transformers); Beta includes torch.compile as the main API for PyTorch 2.0, the scaled_dot_product_attention function as part of torch.nn.functional, the MPS backend, functorch APIs in the torch.func module; and other Beta/Prototype improvements across various inferences, performance and training optimization features on GPUs and CPUs. For a comprehensive introduction and technical overview of torch.compile, please visit the 2.0\nGet Started page\n.\nAlong with 2.0, we are also releasing a series of beta updates to the PyTorch domain libraries, including those that are in-tree, and separate libraries including TorchAudio, TorchVision, and TorchText. An update for TorchX is also being released as it moves to community supported mode. More details can be found in this\nlibrary blog\n.\nThis release is composed of over 4,541 commits and 428 contributors since 1.13.1. We want to sincerely thank our dedicated community for your contributions. As always, we encourage you to try these out and report any issues as we improve 2.0 and the overall 2-series this year.\nSummary:\ntorch.compile is the main API for PyTorch 2.0, which wraps your model and returns a compiled model. It is a fully additive (and optional) feature and hence 2.0 is 100% backward compatible by definition.\nAs an underpinning technology of torch.compile, TorchInductor with Nvidia and AMD GPUs will rely on OpenAI Triton deep learning compiler to generate performant code and hide low level hardware details. OpenAI Triton-generated kernels achieve performance that's on par with hand-written kernels and specialized cuda libraries such as cublas.\nAccelerated Transformers introduce high-performance support for training and inference using a custom kernel architecture for scaled dot product attention (SPDA). The API is integrated with torch.compile() and model developers may also use the\nscaled dot product attention\nkernels directly by calling the new scaled_dot_product_attention() operator.\nMetal Performance Shaders (MPS) backend provides GPU accelerated PyTorch training on Mac platforms with added support for Top 60 most used ops, bringing coverage to over 300 operators.\nAmazon AWS optimize the PyTorch CPU inference on AWS Graviton3 based\nC7g instances\n. PyTorch 2.0 improves inference performance on Graviton compared to the previous releases, including improvements for Resnet50 and Bert.\nNew prototype features and technologies across TensorParallel, DTensor, 2D parallel, TorchDynamo, AOTAutograd, PrimTorch and TorchInductor.\nStable\nBeta\nPrototype\nPlatform Changes\nAccelerated PT 2 Transformers\ntorch.compile\nDTensor\nCUDA support for 11.7 & 11.8 (deprecating CUDA 11.6)\nPyTorch MPS Backend\nTensorParallel\nPython 3.8 (deprecating Python 3.7)\nScaled dot product attention\n2D Parallel\nAWS Graviton3\nFunctorch\nTorch.compile (dynamic=True)\nDispatchable Collectives\ntorch.set_default_device and torch.device as context manager\nX86 quantization backend\nGNN inference and training performance\n*To see a full list of public 2.0, 1.13 and 1.12 feature submissions click\nhere\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\nDrop support for Python versions <= 3.7 (\n#93155\n)\nPreviously the minimum supported version of Python for PyTorch was 3.7. This PR updates the minimum version to require 3.8 in order to install PyTorch. See\nHardware / Software Support\nfor more information.\nDrop support for CUDA 10 (\n#89582\n)\nThis PR updates the minimum CUDA version to 11.0. See the\ngetting-started\nfor installation or\nbuilding from source\nfor more information.\nGradients are now set to\nNone\ninstead of zeros by default in\ntorch.optim.*.zero_grad()\nand\ntorch.nn.Module.zero_grad()\n(\n#92731\n)\nThis changes the default behavior of\nzero_grad()\nto zero out the grads by setting them to\nNone\ninstead of zero tensors.

We’ve\nbegun the deprecation process for some features.\nSee the How to upgrade Django to a newer version guide if you’re updating an existing\nproject.\nPython compatibility¶\nDjango 6.0 supports Python 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14. We highly recommend, and\nonly officially support, the latest release of each series.\nThe Django 5.2.x series is the last to support Python 3.10 and 3.11.\nThird-party library support for older versions of Django¶\nFollowing the release of Django 6.0, we suggest that third-party app authors\ndrop support for all versions of Django prior to 5.2. At that time, you should\nbe able to run your package’s tests using python -Wd so that deprecation\nwarnings appear. After making the deprecation warning fixes, your app should be\ncompatible with Django 6.0.\npython -Wd\nWhat’s new in Django 6.0¶\nContent Security Policy support¶\nBuilt-in support for the Content Security Policy (CSP)\nstandard is now available, making it easier to protect web applications against\ncontent injection attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS). CSP allows\ndeclaring trusted sources of content by giving browsers strict rules about\nwhich scripts, styles, images, or other resources can be loaded.\nCSP policies can now be enforced or monitored directly using built-in tools:\nheaders are added via the\nContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware, nonces are\nsupported through the csp() context\nprocessor, and policies are configured using the SECURE_CSP and\nSECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY settings.\nContentSecurityPolicyMiddleware\ncsp()\nSECURE_CSP\nSECURE_CSP_REPORT_ONLY\nThese settings accept Python dictionaries and support Django-provided constants\nfor clarity and safety. For example:\nfrom django.utils.csp import CSP\n\nSECURE_CSP = {\n    \"default-src\": [CSP.SELF],\n    \"script-src\": [CSP.SELF, CSP.NONCE],\n    \"img-src\": [CSP.SELF, \"https:\"],\n}\nThe resulting Content-Security-Policy header would be set to:\nContent-Security-Policy\ndefault-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-SECRET'; img-src 'self' https:\nTo get started, follow the CSP how-to guide. For in-depth\nguidance, see the CSP security overview and the\nreference docs, which include details about decorators to\noverride or disable policies on a per-view basis.\nTemplate Partials¶\nThe Django Template Language now supports\ntemplate partials, making it easier to encapsulate\nand reuse small named fragments within a template file. The new tags\n{% partialdef %} and {% partial %}\ndefine a partial and render it, respectively.\n{% partialdef %}\n{% partial %}\nPartials can also be referenced using the template_name#partial_name syntax\nwith get_template(),\nrender(), {% include %}, and other\ntemplate-loading tools, enabling more modular and maintainable templates\nwithout needing to split components into separate files.\ntemplate_name#partial_name\nget_template()\nrender()\n{% include %}\nA migration guide is available if you’re updating from the\ndjango-template-partials third-party package.\nBackground Tasks¶\nDjango now includes a built-in Tasks framework for running code outside the\nHTTP request–response cycle. This enables offloading work, such as sending\nemails or processing data, to background workers.\nThe framework provides task definition, validation, queuing, and result\nhandling. Django guarantees consistent behavior for creating and managing\ntasks, while the responsibility for running them continues to belong to\nexternal worker processes.\nTasks are defined using the task() decorator:\ntask()\nfrom django.core.mail import send_mail\nfrom django.tasks import task\n\n\n@task\ndef email_users(emails, subject, message):\n    return send_mail(subject, message, None, emails)\nOnce defined, tasks can be enqueued through a configured backend:\nemail_users.enqueue(\n    emails=[\"user@example.com\"],\n    subject=\"You have a message\",\n    message=\"Hello there!\",\n)\nBackends are configured via the TASKS setting. The two\nbuilt-in backends included in this release are\nprimarily intended for development and testing.\nTASKS\nDjango handles task creation and queuing, but does not provide a worker\nmechanism to run tasks. Execution must be managed by external infrastructure,\nsuch as a separate process or service.\nSee Django’s Tasks framework for an overview and the Tasks reference for API details.\nAdoption of Python’s modern email API¶\nEmail handling in Django now uses Python’s modern email API, introduced in\nPython 3.6. This API, centered around the\nemail.message.EmailMessage class, offers a cleaner and\nUnicode-friendly interface for composing and sending emails. It replaces use of\nPython’s older legacy (Compat32) API, which relied on lower-level MIME\nclasses (from email.mime) and required more manual handling of\nmessage structure and encoding.\nemail.message.EmailMessage\nCompat32\nemail.mime\nNotably, the return type of the EmailMessage.message() method is now an instance of Python’s\nemail.message.EmailMessage. This supports the same API as the\nprevious SafeMIMEText and SafeMIMEMultipart return types, but is not an\ninstance of those now-deprecated classes.\nEmailMessage.message()\nemail.message.EmailMessage\nSafeMIMEText\nSafeMIMEMultipart\nMinor features¶\ndjango.contrib.admin¶\ndjango.contrib.admin\nThe Font Awesome Free icon set (version 6.7.2) is now used for the admin\ninterface icons.\nThe Font Awesome Free icon set (version 6.7.2) is now used for the admin\ninterface icons.\nThe new AdminSite.password_change_form attribute allows customizing\nthe form used in the admin site password change view.\nThe new AdminSite.password_change_form attribute allows customizing\nthe form used in the admin site password change view.\nAdminSite.password_change_form\nMessage levels messages.DEBUG and messages.INFO now have distinct\nicons and CSS styling.

We’ve\nbegun the deprecation process for some features.\nSee the How to upgrade Django to a newer version guide if you’re updating an existing\nproject.\nPython compatibility¶\nDjango 5.0 supports Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12. We highly recommend and\nonly officially support the latest release of each series.\nThe Django 4.2.x series is the last to support Python 3.8 and 3.9.\nThird-party library support for older version of Django¶\nFollowing the release of Django 5.0, we suggest that third-party app authors\ndrop support for all versions of Django prior to 4.2. At that time, you should\nbe able to run your package’s tests using python -Wd so that deprecation\nwarnings appear. After making the deprecation warning fixes, your app should be\ncompatible with Django 5.0.\npython -Wd\nWhat’s new in Django 5.0¶\nFacet filters in the admin¶\nFacet counts are now shown for applied filters in the admin changelist when\ntoggled on via the UI. This behavior can be changed via the new\nModelAdmin.show_facets attribute. For more information see\nFacets.\nModelAdmin.show_facets\nSimplified templates for form field rendering¶\nDjango 5.0 introduces the concept of a field group, and field group templates.\nThis simplifies rendering of the related elements of a Django form field such\nas its label, widget, help text, and errors.\nFor example, the template below:\n<form>\n...\n<div>\n  {{ form.name.label_tag }}\n  {% if form.name.help_text %}\n    <div class=\"helptext\" id=\"{{ form.name.auto_id }}_helptext\">\n      {{ form.name.help_text|safe }}\n    </div>\n  {% endif %}\n  {{ form.name.errors }}\n  {{ form.name }}\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col\">\n      {{ form.email.label_tag }}\n      {% if form.email.help_text %}\n        <div class=\"helptext\" id=\"{{ form.email.auto_id }}_helptext\">\n          {{ form.email.help_text|safe }}\n        </div>\n      {% endif %}\n      {{ form.email.errors }}\n      {{ form.email }}\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"col\">\n      {{ form.password.label_tag }}\n      {% if form.password.help_text %}\n        <div class=\"helptext\" id=\"{{ form.password.auto_id }}_helptext\">\n          {{ form.password.help_text|safe }}\n        </div>\n      {% endif %}\n      {{ form.password.errors }}\n      {{ form.password }}\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n...\n</form>\nCan now be simplified to:\n<form>\n...\n<div>\n  {{ form.name.as_field_group }}\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col\">{{ form.email.as_field_group }}</div>\n    <div class=\"col\">{{ form.password.as_field_group }}</div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n...\n</form>\nas_field_group() renders fields with the\n\"django/forms/field.html\" template by default and can be customized on a\nper-project, per-field, or per-request basis. See\nReusable field group templates.\nas_field_group()\n\"django/forms/field.html\"\nDatabase-computed default values¶\nThe new Field.db_default parameter\nsets a database-computed default value. For example:\nField.db_default\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import Now, Pi\n\n\nclass MyModel(models.Model):\n    age = models.IntegerField(db_default=18)\n    created = models.DateTimeField(db_default=Now())\n    circumference = models.FloatField(db_default=2 * Pi())\nDatabase generated model field¶\nThe new GeneratedField allows creation of database\ngenerated columns. This field can be used on all supported database backends\nto create a field that is always computed from other fields. For example:\nGeneratedField\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import F\n\n\nclass Square(models.Model):\n    side = models.IntegerField()\n    area = models.GeneratedField(\n        expression=F(\"side\") * F(\"side\"),\n        output_field=models.BigIntegerField(),\n        db_persist=True,\n    )\nMore options for declaring field choices¶\nField.choices (for model fields) and ChoiceField.choices\n(for form fields) allow for more flexibility when declaring their values. In\nprevious versions of Django, choices should either be a list of 2-tuples,\nor an Enumeration types subclass, but the latter required\naccessing the .choices attribute to provide the values in the expected\nform:\nField.choices\nChoiceField.choices\nchoices\n.choices\nfrom django.db import models\n\nMedal = models.TextChoices(\"Medal\", \"GOLD SILVER BRONZE\")\n\nSPORT_CHOICES = [\n    (\"Martial Arts\", [(\"judo\", \"Judo\"), (\"karate\", \"Karate\")]),\n    (\"Racket\", [(\"badminton\", \"Badminton\"), (\"tennis\", \"Tennis\")]),\n    (\"unknown\", \"Unknown\"),\n]\n\n\nclass Winner(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(...)\n    medal = models.CharField(..., choices=Medal.choices)\n    sport = models.CharField(..., choices=SPORT_CHOICES)\nDjango 5.0 adds support for accepting a mapping or a callable instead of an\niterable, and also no longer requires .choices to be used directly to\nexpand enumeration types:\n.choices\nfrom django.db import models\n\nMedal = models.TextChoices(\"Medal\", \"GOLD SILVER BRONZE\")\n\nSPORT_CHOICES = {  # Using a mapping instead of a list of 2-tuples.\n    \"Martial Arts\": {\"judo\": \"Judo\", \"karate\": \"Karate\"},\n    \"Racket\": {\"badminton\": \"Badminton\", \"tennis\": \"Tennis\"},\n    \"unknown\": \"Unknown\",\n}\n\n\ndef get_scores():\n    return [(i, str(i)) for i in range(10)]\n\n\nclass Winner(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(...)\n    medal = models.CharField(..., choices=Medal)  # Using `.choices` not required.\n    sport = models.CharField(..., choices=SPORT_CHOICES)\n    score = models.IntegerField(choices=get_scores)  # A callable is allowed.\nUnder the hood the provided choices are normalized into a list of 2-tuples\nas the canonical form whenever the choices value is updated. For more\ninformation, please check the model field reference on choices.\nchoices\nchoices\nMinor features¶\ndjango.contrib.admin¶\ndjango.contrib.admin\nThe new AdminSite.get_log_entries() method allows customizing the\nqueryset for the site’s listed log entries.\nThe new AdminSite.get_log_entries() method allows customizing the\nqueryset for the site’s listed log entries.\nAdminSite.get_log_entries()\nThe django.contrib.admin.AllValuesFieldListFilter,\nChoicesFieldListFilter, RelatedFieldListFilter, and\nRelatedOnlyFieldListFilter admin filters now handle multi-valued query\nparameters.\nThe django.contrib.admin.AllValuesFieldListFilter,\nChoicesFieldListFilter, RelatedFieldListFilter, and\nRelatedOnlyFieldListFilter admin filters now handle multi-valued query\nparameters.\ndjango.contrib.admin.AllValuesFieldListFilter\nChoicesFieldListFilter\nRelatedFieldListFilter\nRelatedOnlyFieldListFilter\nXRegExp is upgraded from version 3.2.0 to 5.1.1.\nXRegExp is upgraded from version 3.2.0 to 5.1.1.\nXRegExp\nThe new AdminSite.get_model_admin() method returns an admin class for\nthe given model class.\nThe new AdminSite.get_model_admin() method returns an admin class for\nthe given model class.\nAdminSite.get_model_admin()\nProperties in ModelAdmin.list_display now support boolean\nattribute.\nProperties in ModelAdmin.list_display now support boolean\nattribute.\nModelAdmin.list_display\nboolean\njQuery is upgraded from version 3.6.4 to 3.7.1.\njQuery is upgraded from version 3.6.4 to 3.7.1.\ndjango.contrib.auth¶\ndjango.contrib.auth\nThe default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher is increased from\n600,000 to 720,000.\nThe default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher is increased from\n600,000 to 720,000.\nThe new asynchronous functions are now provided, using an\na prefix: django.contrib.auth.aauthenticate(),\naget_user(),\nalogin(), alogout(),\nand aupdate_session_auth_hash().\nThe new asynchronous functions are now provided, using an\na prefix: django.contrib.auth.aauthenticate(),\naget_user(),\nalogin(), alogout(),\nand aupdate_session_auth_hash().\na\ndjango.contrib.auth.aauthenticate()\naget_user()\nalogin()\nalogout()\naupdate_session_auth_hash()\nAuthenticationMiddleware now adds an HttpRequest.auser()\nasynchronous method that returns the currently logged-in user.\nAuthenticationMiddleware now adds an HttpRequest.auser()\nasynchronous method that returns the currently logged-in user.\nAuthenticationMiddleware\nHttpRequest.auser()\nThe new django.contrib.auth.hashers.acheck_password() asynchronous\nfunction and AbstractBaseUser.acheck_password() method allow\nasynchronous checking of user passwords.\nThe new django.contrib.auth.hashers.acheck_password() asynchronous\nfunction and AbstractBaseUser.acheck_password() method allow\nasynchronous checking of user passwords.\ndjango.contrib.auth.hashers.acheck_password()\nAbstractBaseUser.acheck_password()\ndjango.contrib.contenttypes¶\ndjango.contrib.contenttypes\nQuerySet.prefetch_related() now supports prefetching\nGenericForeignKey with\nnon-homogeneous set of results.\nQuerySet.prefetch_related() now supports prefetching\nGenericForeignKey with\nnon-homogeneous set of results.\nQuerySet.prefetch_related()\nGenericForeignKey\ndjango.contrib.gis¶\ndjango.contrib.gis\nThe new\nClosestPoint()\nfunction returns a 2-dimensional point on the geometry that is closest to\nanother geometry.\nThe new\nClosestPoint()\nfunction returns a 2-dimensional point on the geometry that is closest to\nanother geometry.\nClosestPoint()\nGIS aggregates now support the filter\nargument.\nGIS aggregates now support the filter\nargument.\nfilter\nSupport for GDAL 3.7 and GEOS 3.12 is added.\nSupport for GDAL 3.7 and GEOS 3.12 is added.\nThe new GEOSGeometry.equals_identical() method allows point-wise\nequivalence checking of geometries.\nThe new GEOSGeometry.equals_identical() method allows point-wise\nequivalence checking of geometries.\nGEOSGeometry.equals_identical()\ndjango.contrib.messages¶\ndjango.contrib.messages\nThe new MessagesTestMixin.assertMessages() assertion method allows\ntesting messages added to a\nresponse.\nThe new MessagesTestMixin.assertMessages() assertion method allows\ntesting messages added to a\nresponse.\nMessagesTestMixin.assertMessages()\nmessages\nresponse\ndjango.contrib.postgres¶\ndjango.contrib.postgres\nThe new violation_error_code attribute of\nExclusionConstraint allows\ncustomizing the code of ValidationError raised during\nmodel validation.\nThe new violation_error_code attribute of\nExclusionConstraint allows\ncustomizing the code of ValidationError raised during\nmodel validation.\nviolation_error_code\nExclusionConstraint\ncode\nValidationError\nAsynchronous views¶\nUnder ASGI, http.disconnect events are now handled.

We’ve\nbegun the deprecation process for some features.\nSee the How to upgrade Django to a newer version guide if you’re updating an existing\nproject.\nPython compatibility¶\nDjango 5.1 supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13 (as of 5.1.3). We\nhighly recommend and only officially support the latest release of each\nseries.\nWhat’s new in Django 5.1¶\n{% querystring %} template tag¶\n{% querystring %}\nDjango 5.1 introduces the {% querystring %} template\ntag, simplifying the modification of query parameters in URLs, making it easier\nto generate links that maintain existing query parameters while adding or\nchanging specific ones.\n{% querystring %}\nFor instance, navigating pagination and query strings in templates can be\ncumbersome. Consider this template fragment that dynamically generates a URL\nfor navigating to the next page within a paginated view:\n{# Linebreaks added for readability, this should be one, long line. #}\n<a href=\"?{% for key, values in request.GET.iterlists %}\n  {% if key != \"page\" %}\n    {% for value in values %}\n      {{ key }}={{ value }}&amp;\n    {% endfor %}\n  {% endif %}\n{% endfor %}page={{ page.next_page_number }}\">Next page</a>\nWhen switching to using this new template tag, the above magically becomes:\n<a href=\"{% querystring page=page.next_page_number %}\">Next page</a>\nPostgreSQL Connection Pools¶\nDjango 5.1 also introduces connection pool support for\nPostgreSQL. As the time to establish a new connection can be relatively long,\nkeeping connections open can reduce latency.\nTo use a connection pool with psycopg, you can set the \"pool\" option\ninside OPTIONS to be a dict to be passed to\nConnectionPool, or to True to use the\nConnectionPool defaults:\n\"pool\"\nOPTIONS\nConnectionPool\nTrue\nConnectionPool\nDATABASES = {\n    \"default\": {\n        \"ENGINE\": \"django.db.backends.postgresql\",\n        # ...\n        \"OPTIONS\": {\n            \"pool\": {\n                \"min_size\": 2,\n                \"max_size\": 4,\n                \"timeout\": 10,\n            }\n        },\n    },\n}\nMiddleware to require authentication by default¶\nThe new LoginRequiredMiddleware\nredirects all unauthenticated requests to a login page. Views can allow\nunauthenticated requests by using the new\nlogin_not_required() decorator.\nLoginRequiredMiddleware\nlogin_not_required()\nLoginRequiredMiddleware respects the login_url and\nredirect_field_name values set via the\nlogin_required() decorator, but does not\nsupport setting login_url or redirect_field_name via the\nLoginRequiredMixin.\nLoginRequiredMiddleware\nlogin_url\nredirect_field_name\nlogin_required()\nlogin_url\nredirect_field_name\nLoginRequiredMixin\nTo enable this, add \"django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware\"\nto your MIDDLEWARE setting.\n\"django.contrib.auth.middleware.LoginRequiredMiddleware\"\nMIDDLEWARE\nMinor features¶\ndjango.contrib.admin¶\ndjango.contrib.admin\nModelAdmin.list_display now supports using __ lookups to list\nfields from related models.\nModelAdmin.list_display now supports using __ lookups to list\nfields from related models.\nModelAdmin.list_display\n__\ndjango.contrib.auth¶\ndjango.contrib.auth\nThe default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher is increased from\n720,000 to 870,000.\nThe default iteration count for the PBKDF2 password hasher is increased from\n720,000 to 870,000.\nThe default parallelism of the ScryptPasswordHasher is\nincreased from 1 to 5, to follow OWASP recommendations.\nThe default parallelism of the ScryptPasswordHasher is\nincreased from 1 to 5, to follow OWASP recommendations.\nparallelism\nScryptPasswordHasher\nThe new AdminUserCreationForm and\nthe existing AdminPasswordChangeForm now\nsupport disabling password-based authentication by setting an unusable\npassword on form save.

    "content": "✨ Support for\nPydantic v2\n✨\nPydantic version 2 has the\ncore\nre-written in\nRust\nand includes a lot of improvements and features, for example:\nImproved\ncorrectness\nin corner cases.\nSafer\ntypes.\nBetter\nperformance\nand\nless energy\nconsumption.\nBetter\nextensibility\n.\netc.\n...all this while keeping the\nsame Python API\n. In most of the cases, for simple models, you can simply upgrade the Pydantic version and get all the benefits. 🚀\nIn some cases, for pure data validation and processing, you can get performance improvements of\n20x\nor more. This means 2,000% or more. 🤯\nWhen you use\nFastAPI\n, there's a lot more going on, processing the request and response, handling dependencies, executing\nyour own code\n, and particularly,\nwaiting for the network\n. But you will probably still get some nice performance improvements just from the upgrade.\nThe focus of this release is\ncompatibility\nwith Pydantic v1 and v2, to make sure your current apps keep working. Later there will be more focus on refactors, correctness, code improvements, and then\nperformance\nimprovements. Some third-party early beta testers that ran benchmarks on the beta releases of FastAPI reported improvements of\n2x - 3x\n. Which is not bad for just doing\npip install --upgrade fastapi pydantic\n. This was not an official benchmark and I didn't check it myself, but it's a good sign.\nMigration\nCheck out the\nPydantic migration guide\n.\nFor the things that need changes in your Pydantic models, the Pydantic team built\nbump-pydantic\n.\nA command line tool that will\nprocess your code\nand update most of the things\nautomatically\nfor you. Make sure you have your code in git first, and review each of the changes to make sure everything is correct before committing the changes.\nPydantic v1\nThis version of FastAPI still supports Pydantic v1\n. And although Pydantic v1 will be deprecated at some point, ti will still be supported for a while.\nThis means that you can install the new Pydantic v2, and if something fails, you can install Pydantic v1 while you fix any problems you might have, but having the latest FastAPI.\nThere are\ntests for both Pydantic v1 and v2\n, and test\ncoverage\nis kept at\n100%\n.\nChanges\nThere are\nnew parameter\nfields supported by Pydantic\nField()\nfor:\nPath()\nQuery()\nHeader()\nCookie()\nBody()\nForm()\nFile()\nThe new parameter fields are:\ndefault_factory\nalias_priority\nvalidation_alias\nserialization_alias\ndiscriminator\nstrict\nmultiple_of\nallow_inf_nan\nmax_digits\ndecimal_places\njson_schema_extra\n...you can read about them in the Pydantic docs.\nThe parameter\nregex\nhas been deprecated and replaced by\npattern\n.\nYou can read more about it in the docs for\nQuery Parameters and String Validations: Add regular expressions\n.\nNew Pydantic models use an improved and simplified attribute\nmodel_config\nthat takes a simple dict instead of an internal class\nConfig\nfor their configuration.\nYou can read more about it in the docs for\nDeclare Request Example Data\n.\nThe attribute\nschema_extra\nfor the internal class\nConfig\nhas been replaced by the key\njson_schema_extra\nin the new\nmodel_config\ndict.\nYou can read more about it in the docs for\nDeclare Request Example Data\n.\nWhen you install\n\"fastapi[all]\"\nit now also includes:\npydantic-settings\n- for settings management.\npydantic-extra-types\n- for extra types to be used with Pydantic.\nNow Pydantic Settings is an additional optional package (included in\n\"fastapi[all]\"\n). To use settings you should now import\nfrom pydantic_settings import BaseSettings\ninstead of importing from\npydantic\ndirectly.\nYou can read more about it in the docs for\nSettings and Environment Variables\n.\nPR\n#9816\nby\n@tiangolo\n, included all the work done (in multiple PRs) on the beta branch (\nmain-pv2\n).",

This attribute\nwould hold too frequent (above\nmax_df\n) but also too rare tokens (below\nmin_df\n). This fixes a potential security issue (data leak) if the discarded\nrare tokens hold sensitive information from the training set without the\nmodel developer’s knowledge.\nNote: users of those classes are encouraged to either retrain their pipelines\nwith the new scikit-learn version or to manually clear the\nstop_words_\nattribute from previously trained instances of those transformers. This\nattribute was designed only for model inspection purposes and has no impact\non the behavior of the transformers.\n#28823\nby\nOlivier Grisel\n.\nChanged models\n#\nEfficiency\nThe subsampling in\npreprocessing.QuantileTransformer\nis now\nmore efficient for dense arrays but the fitted quantiles and the results of\ntransform\nmay be slightly different than before (keeping the same statistical\nproperties).\n#27344\nby\nXuefeng Xu\n.\nEnhancement\ndecomposition.PCA\n,\ndecomposition.SparsePCA\nand\ndecomposition.TruncatedSVD\nnow set the sign of the\ncomponents_\nattribute based on the component values instead of using the transformed data\nas reference.

Previously, the\nMetaData.reflect()\nmethod would need to be\ncalled explicitly each time.\nReferences:\n#5145\nsql\n[sql] [bug]\nFixed stringify for a the\nCreateSchema\nDDL construct, which would\nfail with an\nAttributeError\nwhen stringified without a dialect.\nThis change is also\nbackported\nto: 1.4.47\nReferences:\n#7664\ntyping\n[typing] [bug]\nAdded typing for the built-in generic functions that are available from the\n:data:\n_sql.func\nnamespace, which accept a particular set of arguments and\nreturn a particular type, such as for\n_sql.count\n,\n_sql.current_timestamp\n, etc.\nUnknown interpreted text role \"data\".\nReferences:\n#9129\n[typing] [bug]\nCorrected the type passed for \"lambda statements\" so that a plain lambda is\naccepted by mypy, pyright, others without any errors about argument types.\nAdditionally implemented typing for more of the public API for lambda\nstatements and ensured\nStatementLambdaElement\nis part of the\nExecutable\nhierarchy so it's typed as accepted by\n_engine.Connection.execute()\n.\nReferences:\n#9120\n[typing] [bug]\nThe\n_sql.ColumnOperators.in_()\nand\n_sql.ColumnOperators.not_in()\nmethods are typed to include\nIterable[Any]\nrather than\nSequence[Any]\nfor more flexibility in\nargument type.\nReferences:\n#9122\n[typing] [bug]\nThe\n_sql.or_()\nand\n_sql.and_()\nfrom a typing perspective\nrequire the first argument to be present, however these functions still\naccept zero arguments which will emit a deprecation warning at runtime.\nTyping is also added to support sending the fixed literal\nFalse\nfor\n_sql.or_()\nand\nTrue\nfor\n_sql.and_()\nas the first argument\nonly, however the documentation now indicates sending the\n_sql.false()\nand\n_sql.true()\nconstructs in these cases as a\nmore explicit approach.\nReferences:\n#9123\n[typing] [bug]\nFixed typing issue where iterating over a\n_orm.Query\nobject\nwas not correctly typed.\nReferences:\n#9125\n[typing] [bug]\nFixed typing issue where the object type when using\n_engine.Result\nas a context manager were not preserved, indicating\n_engine.Result\nin all cases rather than the specific\n_engine.Result\nsub-type.\nPull request courtesy Martin Baláž.\nReferences:\n#9136\n[typing] [bug]\nFixed issue where using the\n_orm.relationship.remote_side\nand similar parameters, passing an annotated declarative object typed as\n_orm.Mapped\n, would not be accepted by the type checker.\nReferences:\n#9150\n[typing] [bug]\nAdded typing to legacy operators such as\nisnot()\n,\nnotin_()\n, etc.\nwhich previously were referencing the newer operators but were not\nthemselves typed.\nReferences:\n#9148\nmssql\n[mssql] [bug]\nFixed bug where a schema name given with brackets, but no dots inside the\nname, for parameters such as\n_schema.Table.schema\nwould not be\ninterpreted within the context of the SQL Server dialect's documented\nbehavior of interpreting explicit brackets as token delimiters, first added\nin 1.2 for\n#2626\n, when referring to the schema name in reflection\noperations. The original assumption for\n#2626\n's behavior was that the\nspecial interpretation of brackets was only significant if dots were\npresent, however in practice, the brackets are not included as part of the\nidentifier name for all SQL rendering operations since these are not valid\ncharacters within regular or delimited identifiers.

The logic to reconcile the booleans has been enhanced to\naccommodate a local value of\nFalse\nas still taking precedence over an\nincoming\nTrue\nvalue from the annotated element.\nReferences:\n#11091\n[orm] [bug] [regression]\nFixed regression from version 2.0.28 caused by the fix for\n#11085\nwhere the newer method of adjusting post-cache bound parameter values would\ninterefere with the implementation for the\n_orm.subqueryload()\nloader\noption, which has some more legacy patterns in use internally, when\nthe additional loader criteria feature were used with this loader option.\nReferences:\n#11173\nengine\n[engine] [bug]\nFixed issue in\nengine_insertmanyvalues\nfeature where using a primary\nkey column with an \"inline execute\" default generator such as an explicit\nSequence\nwith an explcit schema name, while at the same time\nusing the\n_engine.Connection.execution_options.schema_translate_map\nfeature would fail to render the sequence or the parameters properly,\nleading to errors.\nReferences:\n#11157\n[engine] [bug]\nMade a change to the adjustment made in version 2.0.10 for\n#9618\n,\nwhich added the behavior of reconciling RETURNING rows from a bulk INSERT\nto the parameters that were passed to it.  This behavior included a\ncomparison of already-DB-converted bound parameter values against returned\nrow values that was not always \"symmetrical\" for SQL column types such as\nUUIDs, depending on specifics of how different DBAPIs receive such values\nversus how they return them, necessitating the need for additional\n\"sentinel value resolver\" methods on these column types.  Unfortunately\nthis broke third party column types such as UUID/GUID types in libraries\nlike SQLModel which did not implement this special method, raising an error\n\"Can't match sentinel values in result set to parameter sets\".  Rather than\nattempt to further explain and document this implementation detail of the\n\"insertmanyvalues\" feature including a public version of the new\nmethod, the approach is intead revised to no longer need this extra\nconversion step, and the logic that does the comparison now works on the\npre-converted bound parameter value compared to the post-result-processed\nvalue, which should always be of a matching datatype.  In the unusual case\nthat a custom SQL column type that also happens to be used in a \"sentinel\"\ncolumn for bulk INSERT is not receiving and returning the same value type,\nthe \"Can't match\" error will be raised, however the mitigation is\nstraightforward in that the same Python datatype should be passed as that\nreturned.\nReferences:\n#11160\nsql\n[sql] [bug] [regression]\nFixed regression from the 1.4 series where the refactor of the\n_types.TypeEngine.with_variant()\nmethod introduced at\nchange_6980\nfailed to accommodate for the\n.copy()\nmethod, which\nwill lose the variant mappings that are set up. This becomes an issue for\nthe very specific case of a \"schema\" type, which includes types such as\nEnum\nand\nARRAY\n, when they are then used in the context\nof an ORM Declarative mapping with mixins where copying of types comes into\nplay.  The variant mapping is now copied as well.\nReferences:\n#11176\ntyping\n[typing] [bug]\nFixed typing issue allowing asyncio\nrun_sync()\nmethods to correctly\ntype the parameters according to the callable that was passed, making use\nof\nPEP 612\nParamSpec\nvariables.  Pull request courtesy Francisco R.\nDel Roio.\nReferences:\n#11055\npostgresql\n[postgresql] [usecase]\nThe PostgreSQL dialect now returns\n_postgresql.DOMAIN\ninstances\nwhen reflecting a column that has a domain as type. Previously, the domain\ndata type was returned instead. As part of this change, the domain\nreflection was improved to also return the collation of the text types.\nPull request courtesy of Thomas Stephenson.\nReferences:\n#10693\ntests\n[tests] [bug]\nBackported to SQLAlchemy 2.0 an improvement to the test suite with regards\nto how asyncio related tests are run, now using the newer Python 3.11\nasyncio.Runner\nor a backported equivalent, rather than relying on the\nprevious implementation based on\nasyncio.get_running_loop()\n.  This\nshould hopefully prevent issues with large suite runs on CPU loaded\nhardware where the event loop seems to become corrupted, leading to\ncascading failures.\nReferences:\n#11187",

By that we mean that we might change how subtests are reported on failure, but the functionality and how to use it are stable.\n#13743\n: Added support for\nnative TOML configuration files\n.\nWhile pytest, since version 6, supports configuration in\npyproject.toml\nfiles under\n[tool.pytest.ini_options]\n,\nit does so in an \"INI compatibility mode\", where all configuration values are treated as strings or list of strings.\nNow, pytest supports the native TOML data model.\nIn\npyproject.toml\n, the native TOML configuration is under the\n[tool.pytest]\ntable.\n#\npyproject.toml\n[\ntool\n.\npytest\n]\nminversion\n=\n\"\n9.0\n\"\naddopts\n= [\n\"\n-ra\n\"\n,\n\"\n-q\n\"\n]\ntestpaths\n= [\n\"\ntests\n\"\n,\n\"\nintegration\n\"\n,\n]\nThe\n[tool.pytest.ini_options]\ntable remains supported, but both tables cannot be used at the same time.\nIf you prefer to use a separate configuration file, or don't use\npyproject.toml\n, you can use\npytest.toml\nor\n.pytest.toml\n:\n#\npytest.toml or .pytest.toml\n[\npytest\n]\nminversion\n=\n\"\n9.0\n\"\naddopts\n= [\n\"\n-ra\n\"\n,\n\"\n-q\n\"\n]\ntestpaths\n= [\n\"\ntests\n\"\n,\n\"\nintegration\n\"\n,\n]\nThe documentation now (sometimes) shows configuration snippets in both TOML and INI formats, in a tabbed interface.\nSee\nconfig file formats\nfor full details.\n#13823\n: Added a\n\"strict mode\"\nenabled by the\nstrict\nconfiguration option.\nWhen set to\ntrue\n, the\nstrict\noption currently enables\nstrict_config\nstrict_markers\nstrict_parametrization_ids\nstrict_xfail\nThe individual strictness options can be explicitly set to override the global\nstrict\nsetting.\nThe previously-deprecated\n--strict\ncommand-line flag now enables strict mode.\nIf pytest adds new strictness options in the future, they will also be enabled in strict mode.\nTherefore, you should only enable strict mode if you use a pinned/locked version of pytest,\nor if you want to proactively adopt new strictness options as they are added.\nSee\nstrict mode\nfor more details.\n#13737\n: Added the\nstrict_parametrization_ids\nconfiguration option.\nWhen set, pytest emits an error if it detects non-unique parameter set IDs,\nrather than automatically making the IDs unique by adding\n0\n,\n1\n, ... to them.\nThis can be particularly useful for catching unintended duplicates.\n#13072\n: Added support for displaying test session\nprogress in the terminal tab\nusing the\nOSC 9;4;\nANSI sequence.\nWhen pytest runs in a supported terminal emulator like ConEmu, Gnome Terminal, Ptyxis, Windows Terminal, Kitty or Ghostty,\nyou'll see the progress in the terminal tab or window,\nallowing you to monitor pytest's progress at a glance.\nThis feature is automatically enabled when running in a TTY.

It will not work if set through other mechanisms, such as\nPYTEST_ADDOPTS\nor\naddopts\n.\n#13823\n: Added\nstrict_xfail\nas an alias to the\nxfail_strict\noption,\nstrict_config\nas an alias to the\n--strict-config\nflag,\nand\nstrict_markers\nas an alias to the\n--strict-markers\nflag.\nThis makes all strictness options consistently have configuration options with the prefix\nstrict_\n.\n#13700\n:\n--junitxml\nno longer prints the\ngenerated xml file\nsummary at the end of the pytest session when\n--quiet\nis given.\n#13732\n: Previously, when filtering warnings, pytest would fail if the filter referenced a class that could not be imported.

This is now a usage error.\n#13722\n: Fixed a misleading assertion failure message when using\npytest.approx\non mappings with differing lengths.\n#13773\n: Fixed the static fixture closure calculation to properly consider transitive dependencies requested by overridden fixtures.\n#13816\n: Fixed\npytest.approx\nwhich now returns a clearer error message when comparing mappings with different keys.\n#13849\n: Hidden\n.pytest.ini\nfiles are now picked up as the config file even if empty.\nThis was an inconsistency with non-hidden\npytest.ini\n.\n#13865\n: Fixed\n--show-capture\nwith\n--tb=line\n.\n#13522\n: Fixed\npytester\nin subprocess mode ignored all :attr`pytester.plugins <pytest.Pytester.plugins>` except the first.\nFixed\npytester\nin subprocess mode silently ignored non-str\npytester.plugins <pytest.Pytester.plugins>\n.\nNow it errors instead.\nIf you are affected by this, specify the plugin by name, or switch the affected tests to use\npytester.runpytest_inprocess <pytest.Pytester.runpytest_inprocess>\nexplicitly instead.\nPackaging updates and notes for downstreams\n#13791\n: Minimum requirements on\niniconfig\nand\npackaging\nwere bumped to\n1.0.1\nand\n22.0.0\n, respectively.\nContributor-facing changes\n#12244\n: Fixed self-test failures when\nTERM=dumb\n.\n#12474\n: Added scheduled GitHub Action Workflow to run Sphinx linkchecks in repo documentation.\n#13621\n: pytest's own testsuite now handles the\nlsof\ncommand hanging (e.g. due to unreachable network filesystems), with the affected selftests being skipped after 10 seconds.\n#13638\n: Fixed deprecated\ngh pr new\ncommand in\nscripts/prepare-release-pr.py\n.\nThe script now uses\ngh pr create\nwhich is compatible with GitHub CLI v2.0+.\n#13695\n: Flush\nstdout\nand\nstderr\nin\nPytester.run\nto avoid truncated outputs in\ntest_faulthandler.py::test_timeout\non CI -- by\nogrisel\n.\n#13771\n: Skip\ntest_do_not_collect_symlink_siblings\non Windows environments without symlink support to avoid false negatives.\n#13841\n:\ntox>=4\nis now required when contributing to pytest.\n#13625\n: Added missing docstrings to\npytest_addoption()\n,\npytest_configure()\n, and\ncacheshow()\nfunctions in\ncacheprovider.py\n.\nMiscellaneous internal changes\n#13830\n: Configuration overrides (\n-o\n/\n--override-ini\n) are now processed during startup rather than during\nconfig.getini() <pytest.Config.getini>\n.",

Pass [--full-trace]{.title-ref} to see hidden and internal frames.\".\nPreviously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.\n#10940\n: Improved verbose output (\n-vv\n) of\nskip\nand\nxfail\nreasons by performing text wrapping while leaving a clear margin for progress output.\nAdded\nTerminalReporter.wrap_write()\nas a helper for that.\n#10991\n: Added handling of\n%f\ndirective to print microseconds in log format options, such as\nlog-date-format\n.\n#11005\n: Added the underlying exception to the cache provider's path creation and write warning messages.\n#11013\n: Added warning when\ntestpaths\n{.interpreted-text role=\"confval\"} is set, but paths are not found by glob. In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the current directory.\n#11043\n: When [--confcutdir]{.title-ref} is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory ([--confcutdir]{.title-ref}) is now set to the\nrootdir <rootdir>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}.\nPreviously in such cases, [conftest.py]{.title-ref} files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.\nIf you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set [--confcutdir]{.title-ref}.\n#11081\n: The\nnorecursedirs\n{.interpreted-text role=\"confval\"} check is now performed in a\npytest_ignore_collect\n{.interpreted-text role=\"hook\"} implementation, so plugins can affect it.\nIf after updating to this version you see that your [norecursedirs]{.title-ref} setting is not being respected,\nit means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad [pytest_ignore_collect]{.title-ref} implementation.\nMost likely, your hook returns [False]{.title-ref} for paths it does not want to ignore,\nwhich ends the processing and doesn't allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.\nThe fix is to return [None]{.title-ref} instead of [False]{.title-ref} for paths your hook doesn't want to ignore.\n#8711\n:\ncaplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"} and\ncaplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}\nwill temporarily enable the requested\nlevel\nif\nlevel\nwas disabled globally via\nlogging.disable(LEVEL)\n.\nBug Fixes\n#10831\n: Terminal Reporting: Fixed bug when running in\n--tb=line\nmode where\npytest.fail(pytrace=False)\ntests report\nNone\n.\n#11068\n: Fixed the\n--last-failed\nwhole-file skipping functionality (\"skipped N files\") for\nnon-python test files <non-python tests>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"}.\n#11104\n: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.3.2 which caused to\ntestpaths\n{.interpreted-text role=\"confval\"} to be considered for loading initial conftests,\neven when it was not utilized (e.g. when explicit paths were given on the command line).\nNow the\ntestpaths\nare only considered when they are in use.\n#1904\n: Fixed traceback entries hidden with\n__tracebackhide__ = True\nstill being shown for chained exceptions (parts after \"... the above exception ...\" message).\n#7781\n: Fix writing non-encodable text to log file when using\n--debug\n.\nImproved Documentation\n#9146\n: Improved documentation for\ncaplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"}.\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n#11031\n: Enhanced the CLI flag for\n-c\nto now include\n--config-file\nto make it clear that this flag applies to the usage of a custom config file.",

    "content": "pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)\nNew features\n#12231\n: Added [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.\nIf the [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.\nThe style of traceback for XFAIL is set with [--tb]{.title-ref}, and can be [auto|long|short|line|native|no]{.title-ref}.\nNote: Even if you have [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} set, you won't see them if [--tb=no]{.title-ref}.\nSome history:\nWith pytest 8.0, [-rx]{.title-ref} or [-ra]{.title-ref} would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.\nThis change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.\n#12281\n: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.\nNow tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\nSupported values are\nint\n{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}, (unescaped)\nstr\n{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"},\nbool\n{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"} &\nNone\n{.interpreted-text role=\"data\"}.\nSee\nmarker examples <marker_keyword_expression_example>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"ref\"} for more information.\n-- by\nlovetheguitar\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}\n#12567\n: Added\n--no-fold-skipped\ncommand line option.\nIf this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\nby reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\nway as other statuses.\n-- by\npbrezina\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}\nImprovements in existing functionality\n#12469\n: The console output now uses the \"third-party plugins\" terminology,\nreplacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\nreference to\nsetuptools <setuptools:index>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"std:doc\"}\n-- by\nwebknjaz\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}.\n#12544\n,\n#12545\n: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\nchecking for a\npyvenv.cfg\n{.interpreted-text role=\"file\"} file, ensuring reliable detection on\nvarious platforms -- by\nzachsnickers\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}.\n#2871\n: Do not truncate arguments to functions in output when running with [-vvv]{.title-ref}.\n#389\n: The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced\n-- by\nfarbodahm\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"},\nwebknjaz\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"},\nobestwalter\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"},\nflub\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}\nand\nglyphack\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}.\nEarlier, it was like:\n=================================== FAILURES ===================================\n_____________________________________ test _____________________________________\ndef test():\n>\nassert\nHelp().fun\n() == 2\nE       assert 1 == 2\nE        +  where 1 = <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>>()\nE        +    where <bound method Help.fun of <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>> = <example.Help instance at 0x256a830>.fun\nE        +      where <example.Help instance at 0x256a830> = Help()\nexample.py:7: AssertionError\n=========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================\nAnd now it's like:\n=================================== FAILURES ===================================\n_____________________________________ test _____________________________________\ndef test():\n>\nassert\nHelp().fun\n() == 2\nE       assert 1 == 2\nE        +  where 1 = fun()\nE        +    where fun = <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230>.fun\nE        +      where <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230> = Help()\ntest_local.py:13: AssertionError\n=========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================\n#7662\n: Added timezone information to the testsuite timestamp in the JUnit XML report.\nBug fixes\n#11706\n: Fixed reporting of teardown errors in higher-scoped fixtures when using [--maxfail]{.title-ref} or [--stepwise]{.title-ref}.\nOriginally added in pytest 8.0.0, but reverted in 8.0.2 due to a regression in pytest-xdist.\nThis regression was fixed in pytest-xdist 3.6.1.\n#11797\n:\npytest.approx\n{.interpreted-text role=\"func\"} now correctly handles\nSequence <collections.abc.Sequence>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"class\"}-like objects.\n#12204\n,\n#12264\n: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0 where tracebacks get longer and longer when multiple\ntests fail due to a shared higher-scope fixture which raised -- by\nbluetech\n{.interpreted-text role=\"user\"}.\nAlso fixed a similar regression in pytest 5.4 for collectors which raise during setup.\nThe fix necessitated internal changes which may affect some plugins:\nFixtureDef.cached_result[2]\nis now a tuple\n(exc, tb)\ninstead of\nexc\n.\nSetupState.stack\nfailures are now a tuple\n(exc, tb)\ninstead of\nexc\n.\n#12275\n: Fixed collection error upon encountering an\nabstract <abc>\n{.interpreted-text role=\"mod\"} class, including abstract [unittest.TestCase]{.title-ref} subclasses.\n#12328\n: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where package-scoped parameterized items were not correctly reordered to minimize setups/teardowns in some cases.\n#12424\n: Fixed crash with [assert testcase is not None]{.title-ref} assertion failure when re-running unittest tests using plugins like pytest-rerunfailures.

    "content": "Celery v5.4.0 and v5.3.x have consistently focused on enhancing the overall QA, both internally and externally.\nThis effort led to the new pytest-celery\nv1.0.0\nrelease, developed concurrently with v5.3.0 & v5.4.0.\nThis release introduces two significant QA enhancements:\nSmoke Tests\n: A new layer of automatic tests has been added to Celery's standard CI. These tests are designed to handle production scenarios and complex conditions efficiently. While new contributions will not be halted due to the lack of smoke tests, we will request smoke tests for advanced changes where appropriate.\nStandalone Bug Report Script\n: The new pytest-celery plugin now allows for encapsulating a complete Celery dockerized setup within a single pytest script. Incorporating these into new bug reports will enable us to reproduce reported bugs deterministically, potentially speeding up the resolution process.\nContrary to the positive developments above, there have been numerous reports about issues with the Redis broker malfunctioning upon restarts and disconnections. Our initial attempts to resolve this were not successful (\n#8796\n).\nWith our enhanced QA capabilities, we are now prepared to address the core issue with Redis (as a broker) again.\nThe rest of the changes for this release are grouped below, with the changes from the latest release candidate listed at the end.\nWhat's Changed\nAdd a Task class specialised for Django (\n#8491\n)\nAdd Google Cloud Storage (GCS) backend (\n#8868\n)\nAdded documentation to the smoke tests infra (\n#8970\n)\nAdded a checklist item for using pytest-celery in a bug report (\n#8971\n)\nBugfix: Missing id on chain (\n#8798\n)\nBugfix: Worker not consuming tasks after Redis broker restart (\n#8796\n)\nCatch UnicodeDecodeError when opening corrupt beat-schedule.db (\n#8806\n)\nchore(ci): Enhance CI with\nworkflow_dispatch\nfor targeted debugging and testing (\n#8826\n)\nDoc: Enhance \"Testing with Celery\" section (\n#8955\n)\nDocfix: pip install celery[sqs] -> pip install \"celery[sqs]\" (\n#8829\n)\nEnable efficient\nchord\nwhen using dynamicdb as backend store (\n#8783\n)\nfeat(daemon): allows daemonization options to be fetched from app settings (\n#8553\n)\nFix DeprecationWarning: datetime.datetime.utcnow() (\n#8726\n)\nFix recursive result parents on group in middle of chain (\n#8903\n)\nFix typos and grammar (\n#8915\n)\nFixed version documentation tag from\n#8553\nin configuration.rst (\n#8802\n)\nHotfix: Smoke tests didn't allow customizing the worker's command arguments, now it does (\n#8937\n)\nMake custom remote control commands available in CLI (\n#8489\n)\nPrint safe_say() to stdout for non-error flows (\n#8919\n)\nSupport moto 5.0 (\n#8838\n)\nUpdate contributing guide to use ssh upstream url (\n#8881\n)\nUpdate optimizing.rst (\n#8945\n)\nUpdated concurrency docs page.

    "content": "Celery v5.5.0 is now available.\nKey Highlights\nSee\nWhat's new in Celery 5.5\nfor a complete overview or read the main highlights below.\nRedis Broker Stability Improvements\nLong-standing disconnection issues with the Redis broker have been identified and resolved in Kombu 5.5.0, which is included with this release. These improvements significantly enhance stability when using Redis as a broker.\nAdditionally, the Redis backend now has better exception handling with the new\nexception_safe_to_retry\nfeature, which improves resilience during temporary Redis connection issues. See\nRedis backend settings\nfor complete documentation.\nContributed by\n@drienkop\nin\n#9614\n.\npycurl\nreplaced with\nurllib3\nReplaced the\npycurl\ndependency with\nurllib3\n.\nWe're monitoring the performance impact of this change and welcome feedback from users who notice any significant differences in their environments.\nContributed by\n@spawn-guy\nin Kombu\n#2134\nand integrated in Celery via\n#9526\n.\nRabbitMQ Quorum Queues Support\nAdded support for RabbitMQ's new\nQuorum Queues\nfeature, including compatibility with ETA tasks. This implementation has some limitations compared to classic queues, so please refer to the documentation for details.\nNative Delayed Delivery\nis automatically enabled when quorum queues are detected to implement the ETA mechanism.\nSee\nUsing Quorum Queues\nfor complete documentation.\nConfiguration options:\nbroker_native_delayed_delivery_queue_type\n: Specifies the queue type for delayed delivery (default:\nquorum\n)\ntask_default_queue_type\n: Sets the default queue type for tasks (default:\nclassic\n)\nworker_detect_quorum_queues\n: Controls automatic detection of quorum queues (default:\nTrue\n)\nContributed in\n#9207\n,\n#9121\n, and\n#9599\n.\nFor details regarding the 404 errors, see\nNew Year's Security Incident\n.\nSoft Shutdown Mechanism\nSoft shutdown is a time limited warm shutdown, initiated just before the cold shutdown. The worker will allow\nworker_soft_shutdown_timeout\nseconds for all currently executing tasks to finish before it terminates. If the time limit is reached, the worker will initiate a cold shutdown and cancel all currently executing tasks.\nThis feature is particularly valuable when using brokers with visibility timeout mechanisms, such as Redis or SQS. It allows the worker enough time to re-queue tasks that were not completed before exiting, preventing task loss during worker shutdown.\nSee\nStopping the worker\nfor complete documentation on worker shutdown types.\nConfiguration options:\nworker_soft_shutdown_timeout\n: Sets the duration in seconds for the soft shutdown period (default:\n0.0\n, disabled)\nworker_enable_soft_shutdown_on_idle\n: Controls whether soft shutdown should be enabled even when the worker is idle (default:\nFalse\n)\nContributed by\n@Nusnus\nin\n#9213\n,\n#9231\n, and\n#9238\n.\nPydantic Support\nNew native support for Pydantic models in tasks. This integration allows you to leverage Pydantic's powerful data validation and serialization capabilities directly in your Celery tasks.\nExample usage:\nfrom\npydantic\nimport\nBaseModel\nfrom\ncelery\nimport\nCelery\napp\n=\nCelery\n(\n'tasks'\n)\nclass\nArgModel\n(\nBaseModel\n):\nvalue\n:\nint\nclass\nReturnModel\n(\nBaseModel\n):\nvalue\n:\nstr\n@\napp\n.\ntask\n(\npydantic\n=\nTrue\n)\ndef\nx\n(\narg\n:\nArgModel\n)\n->\nReturnModel\n:\n# args/kwargs type hinted as Pydantic model will be converted\nassert\nisinstance\n(\narg\n,\nArgModel\n)\n# The returned model will be converted to a dict automatically\nreturn\nReturnModel\n(\nvalue\n=\nf\"example:\n{\narg\n.\nvalue\n}\n\"\n)\nSee\nArgument validation with Pydantic\nfor complete documentation.\nConfiguration options:\npydantic=True\n: Enables Pydantic integration for the task\npydantic_strict=True/False\n: Controls whether strict validation is enabled (default:\nFalse\n)\npydantic_context={...}\n: Provides additional context for validation\npydantic_dump_kwargs={...}\n: Customizes serialization behavior\nContributed by\n@mathiasertl\nin\n#9023\n,\n#9319\n, and\n#9393\n.\nGoogle Pub/Sub Transport\nNew support for Google Cloud Pub/Sub as a message transport, expanding Celery's cloud integration options.\nSee\nGoogle Pub/Sub Transport\nfor complete documentation.\nFor the Google Pub/Sub support you have to install additional dependencies:\n$ pip install\n\"\ncelery[gcpubsub]\n\"\nThen configure your Celery application to use the Google Pub/Sub transport:\nbroker_url\n=\n'gcpubsub://projects/project-id'\nContributed by\n@haimjether\nin\n#9351\n.\nPython 3.13 Support\nOfficial support for Python 3.13. All core dependencies have been updated to ensure compatibility, including Kombu and py-amqp.\nThis release maintains compatibility with Python 3.8 through 3.13, as well as PyPy 3.10+.\nContributed by\n@Nusnus\nin\n#9309\nand\n#9350\n.\nREMAP_SIGTERM Support\nThe \"REMAP_SIGTERM\" feature, previously undocumented, has been tested, documented, and is now officially supported. This feature allows you to remap the SIGTERM signal to SIGQUIT, enabling you to initiate a soft or cold shutdown using TERM instead of QUIT.\nThis is particularly useful in containerized environments where SIGTERM is the standard signal for graceful termination.\nSee\nCold Shutdown documentation\nfor more info.\nTo enable this feature, set the environment variable:\nexport\nREMAP_SIGTERM=\n\"\nSIGQUIT\n\"\nContributed by\n@Nusnus\nin\n#9461\n.\nDatabase Backend Improvements\nNew\ncreate_tables_at_setup\noption for the database backend. This option controls when database tables are created, allowing for non-lazy table creation.\nBy default (\ncreate_tables_at_setup=True\n), tables are created during backend initialization. Setting this to\nFalse\ndefers table creation until they are actually needed, which can be useful in certain deployment scenarios where you want more control over database schema management.\nSee\nDatabase backend settings\nfor complete documentation.\nConfiguration:\napp\n.\nconf\n.\nresult_backend\n=\n'db+sqlite:///results.db'\napp\n.\nconf\n.\ndatabase_create_tables_at_setup\n=\nFalse\nContributed

    "release_date": "2024-10-24T23:51:36Z",
    "content": "Release 2.18.0\nTensorFlow\nBreaking Changes\ntf.lite\nC API:\nAn optional, fourth parameter was added\nTfLiteOperatorCreate\nas a step forward towards a cleaner API for\nTfLiteOperator\n. Function\nTfLiteOperatorCreate\nwas added recently, in TensorFlow Lite version 2.17.0, released on 7/11/2024, and we do not expect there will be much code using this function yet. Any code breakages can be easily resolved by passing nullptr as the new, 4th parameter.\nTensorRT support is disabled in CUDA builds for code health improvement.\nHermetic CUDA support is added.\nHermetic CUDA uses a specific downloadable version of CUDA instead of the user’s locally installed CUDA. Bazel will download CUDA, CUDNN and NCCL distributions, and then use CUDA libraries and tools as dependencies in various Bazel targets. This enables more reproducible builds for Google ML projects and supported CUDA versions.\nKnown Caveats\nMajor Features and Improvements\nTensorFlow now supports and is compiled with NumPy 2.0 by default. Please see the\nNumPy 2 release notes\nand the\nNumPy 2 migration guide\n.\nNote that NumPy's type promotion rules have been changed(See\nNEP 50\nfor details). This may change the precision at which computations happen, leading either to type errors or to numerical changes to results.\nTensorflow will continue to support NumPy 1.26 until 2025, aligning with community standard deprecation timeline\nhere\n.\ntf.lite\n:\nThe LiteRT\nrepo\nis live (see\nannouncement\n), which means that in the coming months there will be changes to the development experience for TFLite. The TF Lite Runtime source will be moved later this year, and sometime after that we will start accepting contributions through that repo.\nSignatureRunner is now supported for models with no signatures.\nBug Fixes and Other Changes\ntf.data\nAdd optional\nsynchronous\nargument to\nmap\n, to specify that the\nmap\nshould run synchronously, as opposed to be parallelizable when\noptions.experimental_optimization.map_parallelization=True\n. This saves memory compared to setting\nnum_parallel_calls=1\n.\nAdd optional\nuse_unbounded_threadpool\nargument to\nmap\n, to specify that the\nmap\nshould use an unbounded threadpool instead of the default pool that is based on the number of cores on the machine. This can improve throughput for map functions which perform IO or otherwise release the CPU.\nAdd\ntf.data.experimental.get_model_proto\nto allow users to peek into the analytical model inside of a dataset iterator.\ntf.lite\nDequantize\nop supports\nTensorType_INT4\n.\nThis change includes per-channel dequantization.\nAdd support for\nstablehlo.composite\n.\nEmbeddingLookup\nop supports per-channel quantization and\nTensorType_INT4\nvalues.\nFullyConnected\nop supports\nTensorType_INT16\nactivation and\nTensorType_Int4\nweight per-channel quantization.\ntf.tensor_scatter_update\n,\ntf.tensor_scatter_add\nand of other reduce types.\nSupport\nbad_indices_policy\n.\nThanks to our Contributors\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\nAkhil Goel, akhilgoe, Alexander Pivovarov, Amir Samani, Andrew Goodbody, Andrey Portnoy, Anthony Platanios, bernardoArcari, Brett Taylor, buptzyb, Chao, Christian Clauss, Cocoa, Daniil Kutz, Darya Parygina, dependabot[bot], Dimitris Vardoulakis, Dragan Mladjenovic, Elfie Guo, eukub, Faijul Amin, flyingcat, Frédéric Bastien, ganyu.08, Georg Stefan Schmid, Grigory Reznikov, Harsha H S, Harshit Monish, Heiner, Ilia Sergachev, Jan, Jane Liu, Jaroslav Sevcik, Kaixi Hou, Kanvi Khanna, Kristof Maar, Kristóf Maár, LakshmiKalaKadali, Lbertho-Gpsw, lingzhi98, MarcoFalke, Masahiro Hiramori, Mmakevic-Amd, mraunak, Nobuo Tsukamoto, Notheisz57, Olli Lupton, Pearu Peterson, pemeliya, Peyara Nando, Philipp Hack, Phuong Nguyen, Pol Dellaiera, Rahul Batra, Ruturaj Vaidya, sachinmuradi, Sergey Kozub, Shanbin Ke, Sheng Yang, shengyu, Shraiysh, Shu Wang, Surya, sushreebarsa, Swatheesh-Mcw, syzygial, Tai Ly, terryysun, tilakrayal, Tj Xu, Trevor Morris, Tzung-Han Juang, wenchenvincent, wondertx, Xuefei Jiang, Ye Huang, Yimei Sun, Yunlong Liu, Zahid Iqbal, Zhan Lu, Zoranjovanovic-Ns, Zuri Obozuwa",

This can cause breakages where existing calls pass Tensors with the wrong shape or omit certain non-Tensor arguments (including default values).\ntf.nn\ntf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse\nand\ntf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse\nnow support ids and weights described by\ntf.RaggedTensor\ns.\nAdded a new boolean argument\nallow_fast_lookup\nto\ntf.nn.embedding_lookup_sparse\nand\ntf.nn.safe_embedding_lookup_sparse\n, which enables a simplified and typically faster lookup procedure.\ntf.data\ntf.data.Dataset.zip\nnow supports Python-style zipping, i.e.\nDataset.zip(a, b, c)\n.\ntf.data.Dataset.shuffle\nnow supports\ntf.data.UNKNOWN_CARDINALITY\nWhen doing a \"full shuffle\" using\ndataset = dataset.shuffle(dataset.cardinality())\n. But remember, a \"full shuffle\" will load the full dataset into memory so that it can be shuffled, so make sure to only use this with small datasets or datasets of small objects (like filenames).\ntf.math\ntf.nn.top_k\nnow supports specifying the output index type via parameter\nindex_type\n.  Supported types are\ntf.int16\n,\ntf.int32\n(default), and\ntf.int64\n.\ntf.SavedModel\nIntroduced class method\ntf.saved_model.experimental.Fingerprint.from_proto(proto)\n, which can be used to construct a\nFingerprint\nobject directly from a protobuf.\nIntroduced member method\ntf.saved_model.experimental.Fingerprint.singleprint()\n, which provides a convenient way to uniquely identify a SavedModel.\nBug Fixes and Other Changes\ntf.Variable\nChanged resource variables to inherit from\ntf.compat.v2.Variable\ninstead of\ntf.compat.v1.Variable\n. Some checks for\nisinstance(v, tf compat.v1.Variable)\nthat previously returned True may now return False.\ntf.distribute\nOpened an experimental API,\ntf.distribute.experimental.coordinator.get_current_worker_index\n, for retrieving the worker index from within a worker, when using parameter server training with a custom training loop.\ntf.experimental.dtensor\nDeprecated\ndtensor.run_on\nin favor of\ndtensor.default_mesh\nto correctly indicate that the context does not override the mesh that the ops and functions will run on, it only sets a fallback default mesh.\nList of members of\ndtensor.Layout\nand\ndtensor.Mesh\nhave slightly changed as part of efforts to consolidate the C++ and Python source code with pybind11. Most notably,\ndtensor.Layout.serialized_string\nis removed.\nMinor API changes to represent Single Device Layout for non-distributed Tensors inside DTensor functions. Runtime support will be added soon.\ntf.experimental.ExtensionType\ntf.experimental.ExtensionType\nnow supports Python\ntuple\nas the type annotation of its fields.\ntf.nest\nDeprecated API\ntf.nest.is_sequence\nhas now been deleted. Please use\ntf.nest.is_nested\ninstead.\nKeras\nKeras is a framework built on top of the TensorFlow. See more details on the\nKeras website\n.\nBreaking Changes\nRemoved the Keras scikit-learn API wrappers (\nKerasClassifier\nand\nKerasRegressor\n), which had been deprecated in August 2021. We recommend using\nSciKeras\ninstead.\nThe default Keras model saving format is now the Keras v3 format: calling\nmodel.save(\"xyz.keras\")\nwill no longer create a H5 file, it will create a native Keras model file. This will only be breaking for you if you were manually inspecting or modifying H5 files saved by Keras under a\n.keras\nextension. If this breaks you, simply add\nsave_format=\"h5\"\nto your\n.save()\ncall to revert back to the prior behavior.\nAdded\nkeras.utils.TimedThread\nutility to run a timed thread every x seconds. It can be used to run a threaded function alongside model training or any other snippet of code.\nIn the\nkeras\nPyPI package, accessible symbols are now restricted to symbols that are intended to be public. This may affect your code if you were using\nimport keras\nand you used\nkeras\nfunctions that were not public APIs, but were accessible in earlier versions with direct imports. In those cases, please use the following guideline:\n-  The API may be available in the public Keras API under a different name, so make sure to look for it on keras.io or TensorFlow docs and switch to the public version.\n-  It could also be a simple python or TF utility that you could easily copy over to your own codebase. In those case, just make it your own!\n-  If you believe it should definitely be a public Keras API, please open a feature request in keras GitHub repo.\n-  As a workaround, you could import the same private symbol keras\nkeras.src\n, but keep in mind the\nsrc\nnamespace is not stable and those APIs may change or be removed in the future.\nMajor Features and Improvements\nAdded F-Score metrics\ntf.keras.metrics.FBetaScore\n,\ntf.keras.metrics.F1Score\n, and\ntf.keras.metrics.R2Score\n.\nAdded activation function\ntf.keras.activations.mish\n.\nAdded experimental\nkeras.metrics.experimental.PyMetric\nAPI for metrics that run Python code on the host CPU (compiled outside of the TensorFlow graph). This can be used for integrating metrics from external Python libraries (like sklearn or pycocotools) into Keras as first-class Keras metrics.\nAdded\ntf.keras.optimizers.Lion\noptimizer.\nAdded\ntf.keras.layers.SpectralNormalization\nlayer wrapper to perform spectral normalization on the weights of a target layer.\nThe\nSidecarEvaluatorModelExport\ncallback has been added to Keras as\nkeras.callbacks.SidecarEvaluatorModelExport\n. This callback allows for exporting the model the best-scoring model as evaluated by a\nSidecarEvaluator\nevaluator. The evaluator regularly evaluates the model and exports it if the user-defined comparison function determines that it is an improvement.\nAdded warmup capabilities to\ntf.keras.optimizers.schedules.CosineDecay\nlearning rate scheduler. You can now specify an initial and target learning rate, and our scheduler will perform a linear interpolation between the two after which it will begin a decay phase.\nAdded experimental support for an exactly-once visitation guarantee for evaluating Keras models trained with\ntf.distribute ParameterServerStrategy\n, via the\nexact_evaluation_shards\nargument in\nModel.fit\nand\nModel.evaluate\n.\nAdded\ntf.keras.__internal__.KerasTensor\n,\ntf.keras.__internal__.SparseKerasTensor\n, and\ntf.keras.__internal__.RaggedKerasTensor\nclasses. You can use these classes to do instance type checking and type annotations for layer/model inputs and outputs.\nAll the\ntf.keras.dtensor.experimental.optimizers\nclasses have been merged with\ntf.keras.optimizers\n. You can migrate your code to use\ntf.keras.optimizers\ndirectly. The API namespace for\ntf.keras.dtensor.experimental.optimizers\nwill be removed in future releases.\nAdded support for\nclass_weight\nfor 3+ dimensional targets (e.g. image segmentation masks) in\nModel.fit\n.\nAdded a new loss,\nkeras.losses.CategoricalFocalCrossentropy\n.\nRemove the\ntf.keras.dtensor.experimental.layout_map_scope()\n. You can user the\ntf.keras.dtensor.experimental.LayoutMap.scope()\ninstead.\nSecurity\nFixes correct values rank in UpperBound and LowerBound\nCVE-2023-33976\nThanks to our Contributors\nThis release contains contributions from many people at Google, as well as:\n103yiran, 8bitmp3, Aakar, Aakar Dwivedi, Abinash Satapathy, Aditya Kane, ag.ramesh, Alexander Grund, Andrei Pikas, andreii, Andrew Goodbody, angerson, Anthony_256, Ashay Rane, Ashiq Imran, Awsaf, Balint Cristian, Banikumar Maiti (Intel Aipg), Ben Barsdell, bhack, cfRod, Chao Chen, chenchongsong, Chris Mc, Daniil Kutz, David Rubinstein, dianjiaogit, dixr, Dongfeng Yu, dongfengy, drah, Eric Kunze, Feiyue Chen, Frederic Bastien, Gauri1 Deshpande, guozhong.zhuang, hDn248, HYChou, ingkarat, James Hilliard, Jason Furmanek, Jaya, Jens Glaser, Jerry Ge, Jiao Dian'S Power Plant, Jie Fu, Jinzhe Zeng, Jukyy, Kaixi Hou, Kanvi Khanna, Karel Ha, karllessard, Koan-Sin Tan, Konstantin Beluchenko, Kulin Seth, Kun Lu, Kyle Gerard Felker, Leopold Cambier, Lianmin Zheng, linlifan, liuyuanqiang, Lukas Geiger, Luke Hutton, Mahmoud Abuzaina, Manas Mohanty, Mateo Fidabel, Maxiwell S.

    "content": "Release Notes\nCheck out the\nblog post\nfor a migration guide and overview of the changes!\nBreaking changes\nSeveral rules can now add\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nautomatically\nTC001\n,\nTC002\n,\nTC003\n,\nRUF013\n, and\nUP037\nnow add\nfrom __future__ import annotations\nas part of their fixes when the\nlint.future-annotations\nsetting is enabled. This allows the rules to move more imports into\nTYPE_CHECKING\nblocks (\nTC001\n,\nTC002\n, and\nTC003\n), use PEP 604 union syntax on Python versions before 3.10 (\nRUF013\n), and unquote more annotations (\nUP037\n).\nFull module paths are now used to verify first-party modules\nRuff now checks that the full path to a module exists on disk before categorizing it as a first-party import. This change makes first-party import detection more accurate, helping to avoid false positives on local directories with the same name as a third-party dependency, for example. See the\nFAQ section\non import categorization for more details.\nDeprecated rules must now be selected by exact rule code\nRuff will no longer activate deprecated rules selected by their group name or prefix. As noted below, the two remaining deprecated rules were also removed in this release, so this won't affect any current rules, but it will still affect any deprecations in the future.\nThe deprecated macOS configuration directory fallback has been removed\nRuff will no longer look for a user-level configuration file at\n~/Library/Application Support/ruff/ruff.toml\non macOS. This feature was deprecated in v0.5 in favor of using the\nXDG specification\n(usually resolving to\n~/.config/ruff/ruff.toml\n), like on Linux. The fallback and accompanying deprecation warning have now been removed.\nRemoved Rules\nThe following rules have been removed:\npandas-df-variable-name\n(\nPD901\n)\nnon-pep604-isinstance\n(\nUP038\n)\nStabilization\nThe following rules have been stabilized and are no longer in preview:\nairflow-dag-no-schedule-argument\n(\nAIR002\n)\nairflow3-removal\n(\nAIR301\n)\nairflow3-moved-to-provider\n(\nAIR302\n)\nairflow3-suggested-update\n(\nAIR311\n)\nairflow3-suggested-to-move-to-provider\n(\nAIR312\n)\nlong-sleep-not-forever\n(\nASYNC116\n)\nf-string-number-format\n(\nFURB116\n)\nos-symlink\n(\nPTH211\n)\ngeneric-not-last-base-class\n(\nPYI059\n)\nredundant-none-literal\n(\nPYI061\n)\npytest-raises-ambiguous-pattern\n(\nRUF043\n)\nunused-unpacked-variable\n(\nRUF059\n)\nuseless-class-metaclass-type\n(\nUP050\n)\nThe following behaviors have been stabilized:\nassert-raises-exception\n(\nB017\n) now checks for direct calls to\nunittest.TestCase.assert_raises\nand\npytest.raises\ninstead of only the context manager forms.\nmissing-trailing-comma\n(\nCOM812\n) and\nprohibited-trailing-comma\n(\nCOM819\n) now check for trailing commas in PEP 695 type parameter lists.\nraw-string-in-exception\n(\nEM101\n) now also checks for byte strings in exception messages.\ninvalid-mock-access\n(\nPGH005\n) now checks for\nAsyncMock\nmethods like\nnot_awaited\nin addition to the synchronous variants.\nuseless-import-alias\n(\nPLC0414\n) no longer applies to\n__init__.py\nfiles, where it conflicted with one of the suggested fixes for\nunused-import\n(\nF401\n).\nbidirectional-unicode\n(\nPLE2502\n) now also checks for U+061C (Arabic Letter Mark).\nThe fix for\nmultiple-with-statements\n(\nSIM117\n) is now marked as always safe.\nPreview features\n[\npyupgrade\n] Enable\nUP043\nin stub files (\n#20027\n)\nBug fixes\n[\npyupgrade\n] Apply\nUP008\nonly when the\n__class__\ncell exists (\n#19424\n)\n[\nruff\n] Fix empty f-string detection in\nin-empty-collection\n(\nRUF060\n) (\n#20249\n)\nServer\nAdd support for using uv as an alternative formatter backend (\n#19665\n)\nDocumentation\n[\npep8-naming\n] Fix formatting of\n__all__\n(\nN816\n) (\n#20301\n)\nContributors\n@AlexWaygood\n@BurntSushi\n@CodeMan62\n@IDrokin117\n@JelleZijlstra\n@LoicRiegel\n@Renkai\n@Renkai\n@TaKO8Ki\n@amyreese\n@carljm\n@dcreager\n@ericmarkmartin\n@ferdnyc\n@ibraheemdev\n@mtshiba\n@ntBre\n@onerandomusername\n@renovate\n@sharkdp\n@thejchap\n@zanieb\nInstall ruff 0.13.0\nInstall prebuilt binaries via shell script\ncurl --proto\n'\n=https\n'\n--tlsv1.2 -LsSf https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/download/0.13.0/ruff-installer.sh\n|\nsh\nInstall prebuilt binaries via powershell script\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c\n\"\nirm https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/releases/download/0.13.0/ruff-installer.ps1 | iex\n\"\nDownload ruff 0.13.0\nFile\nPlatform\nChecksum\nruff-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz\nApple Silicon macOS\nchecksum\nruff-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz\nIntel macOS\nchecksum\nruff-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.zip\nARM64 Windows\nchecksum\nruff-i686-pc-windows-msvc.zip\nx86 Windows\nchecksum\nruff-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip\nx64 Windows\nchecksum\nruff-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nARM64 Linux\nchecksum\nruff-i686-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nx86 Linux\nchecksum\nruff-powerpc64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nPPC64 Linux\nchecksum\nruff-powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nPPC64LE Linux\nchecksum\nruff-riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nRISCV Linux\nchecksum\nruff-s390x-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nS390x Linux\nchecksum\nruff-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nx64 Linux\nchecksum\nruff-armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz\nARMv7 Linux\nchecksum\nruff-aarch64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz\nARM64 MUSL Linux\nchecksum\nruff-i686-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz\nx86 MUSL Linux\nchecksum\nruff-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz\nx64 MUSL Linux\nchecksum\nruff-arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz\nARMv6 MUSL Linux (Hardfloat)\nchecksum\nruff-armv7-unknown-linux-musleabihf.tar.gz\nARMv7 MUSL Linux\nchecksum",

    "content": "v0.32.0 (Aug 13, 2024)\n¶\nThis release introduces support for type hints in UDFs/custom functions. Type hints can be used alone or alongside decorators to specify data conversion between Excel and Python:\nfrom\nxlwings\nimport\nfunc\n# or: from xlwings.server import func\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\n@func\ndef\nmyfunction\n(\ndf\n:\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n)\n->\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n:\n# df is a DataFrame, do something with it\nreturn\ndf\nIn this example, the return type (\n->\npd.DataFrame\n) is optional, as xlwings automatically checks the type of the returned object.\nIf you need to provide additional conversion arguments, you can either provide them via an annotated type hint or via a decorator. Note that when you use type hints and decorators together, decorators override type hints for conversion.\nTo set\nindex=False\nfor both the argument and the return value, you can annotate the type hint like this:\nfrom\ntyping\nimport\nAnnotated\nfrom\nxlwings\nimport\nfunc\n# or: from xlwings.server import func\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\n@func\ndef\nmyfunction\n(\ndf\n:\nAnnotated\n[\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n,\n{\n\"index\"\n:\nFalse\n}]\n)\n->\nAnnotated\n[\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n,\n{\n\"index\"\n:\nFalse\n}]:\n# df is a DataFrame, do something with it\nreturn\ndf\nAs this might be a little harder to read, you can extract the type definition, which also allows you to reuse it like so:\nfrom\ntyping\nimport\nAnnotated\nfrom\nxlwings\nimport\nfunc\n# or: from xlwings.server import func\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\nDf\n=\nAnnotated\n[\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n,\n{\n\"index\"\n:\nFalse\n}]\n@func\ndef\nmyfunction\n(\ndf\n:\nDf\n)\n->\nDf\n:\n# df is a DataFrame, do something with it\nreturn\ndf\nAlternatively, you could also combine type hints with decorators:\nfrom\ntyping\nimport\nAnnotated\nfrom\nxlwings\nimport\nfunc\n,\narg\n,\nret\n# or: from xlwings.server import func, arg, ret\nimport\npandas\nas\npd\n@func\n@arg\n(\n\"df\"\n,\nindex\n=\nFalse\n)\n@ret\n(\nindex\n=\nFalse\n)\ndef\nmyfunction\n(\ndf\n:\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n)\n->\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n:\n# df is a DataFrame, do something with it\nreturn\ndf\nOther changes include:\nBreaking Change\nDropped Python 3.8 support (\nGH 2497\n).\nBug Fix\nv0.31.4 introduced a change that would set the Matplotlib backend to\nagg\nglobally. This has been reverted (\nGH 2484\n).\nEnhancement\nPRO\nxlwings Reports: when using Markdown functionality,\nmistune\nis now required as dependency (\nGH 2498\n).\nBug Fix\nPRO\nFixed a bug with streaming functions (\nGH 2491\n).",

If it returns a string, Fire will display that string. If it returns None, Fire will display nothing. If it returns something else, Fire will use the default serialization method to convert it to text.\nThe default serialization remains unchanged from previous versions. Primitives and collections of primitives are serialized one item per line. Objects that define a custom\n__str__\nfunction are serialized using that. Complex objects that don't define\n__str__\ntrigger their help screen rather than being serialized and displayed.",

See\nRelease notes\nfor a full changelog\nincluding other versions of pandas.\nUpcoming changes in pandas 3.0\n#\npandas 3.0 will bring two bigger changes to the default behavior of pandas.\nCopy-on-Write\n#\nThe currently optional mode Copy-on-Write will be enabled by default in pandas 3.0. There\nwonât be an option to keep the current behavior enabled. The new behavioral semantics are\nexplained in the\nuser guide about Copy-on-Write\n.\nThe new behavior can be enabled since pandas 2.0 with the following option:\npd\n.\noptions\n.\nmode\n.\ncopy_on_write\n=\nTrue\nThis change brings different changes in behavior in how pandas operates with respect to\ncopies and views. Some of these changes allow a clear deprecation, like the changes in\nchained assignment. Other changes are more subtle and thus, the warnings are hidden behind\nan option that can be enabled in pandas 2.2.\npd\n.\noptions\n.\nmode\n.\ncopy_on_write\n=\n\"warn\"\nThis mode will warn in many different scenarios that arenât actually relevant to\nmost queries. We recommend exploring this mode, but it is not necessary to get rid\nof all of these warnings. The\nmigration guide\nexplains the upgrade process in more detail.\nDedicated string data type (backed by Arrow) by default\n#\nHistorically, pandas represented string columns with NumPy object data type. This\nrepresentation has numerous problems, including slow performance and a large memory\nfootprint. This will change in pandas 3.0. pandas will start inferring string columns\nas a new\nstring\ndata type, backed by Arrow, which represents strings contiguous in memory. This brings\na huge performance and memory improvement.\nOld behavior:\nIn [1]:\nser\n=\npd\n.\nSeries\n([\n\"a\"\n,\n\"b\"\n])\nOut[1]:\n0    a\n1    b\ndtype: object\nNew behavior:\nIn [1]:\nser\n=\npd\n.\nSeries\n([\n\"a\"\n,\n\"b\"\n])\nOut[1]:\n0    a\n1    b\ndtype: string\nThe string data type that is used in these scenarios will mostly behave as NumPy\nobject would, including missing value semantics and general operations on these\ncolumns.\nThis change includes a few additional changes across the API:\nCurrently, specifying\ndtype=\"string\"\ncreates a dtype that is backed by Python strings\nwhich are stored in a NumPy array. This will change in pandas 3.0, this dtype\nwill create an Arrow backed string column.\nThe column names and the Index will also be backed by Arrow strings.\nPyArrow will become a required dependency with pandas 3.0 to accommodate this change.\nThis future dtype inference logic can be enabled with:\npd\n.\noptions\n.\nfuture\n.\ninfer_string\n=\nTrue\nEnhancements\n#\nADBC Driver support in to_sql and read_sql\n#\nread_sql()\nand\nto_sql()\nnow work with\nApache Arrow ADBC\ndrivers. Compared to\ntraditional drivers used via SQLAlchemy, ADBC drivers should provide\nsignificant performance improvements, better type support and cleaner\nnullability handling.\nimport\nadbc_driver_postgresql.dbapi\nas\npg_dbapi\ndf\n=\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n(\n[\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\n[\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n],\n],\ncolumns\n=\n[\n'a'\n,\n'b'\n,\n'c'\n]\n)\nuri\n=\n\"postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost/postgres\"\nwith\npg_dbapi\n.\nconnect\n(\nuri\n)\nas\nconn\n:\ndf\n.\nto_sql\n(\n\"pandas_table\"\n,\nconn\n,\nindex\n=\nFalse\n)\n# for round-tripping\nwith\npg_dbapi\n.\nconnect\n(\nuri\n)\nas\nconn\n:\ndf2\n=\npd\n.\nread_sql\n(\n\"pandas_table\"\n,\nconn\n)\nThe Arrow type system offers a wider array of types that can more closely match\nwhat databases like PostgreSQL can offer.

Depending on the type and order of those operations\nthis currently does or does not work.\nA typical example is as follows:\ndf\n=\npd\n.\nDataFrame\n({\n\"foo\"\n:\n[\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\n\"bar\"\n:\n[\n4\n,\n5\n,\n6\n]})\n# first selecting rows with a mask, then assigning values to a column\n# -> this has never worked and raises a SettingWithCopyWarning\ndf\n[\ndf\n[\n\"bar\"\n]\n>\n5\n][\n\"foo\"\n]\n=\n100\n# first selecting the column, and then assigning to a subset of that column\n# -> this currently works\ndf\n[\n\"foo\"\n][\ndf\n[\n\"bar\"\n]\n>\n5\n]\n=\n100\nThis second example of chained assignment currently works to update the original\ndf\n.\nThis will no longer work in pandas 3.0, and therefore we started deprecating this:\n>>>\ndf\n[\n\"foo\"\n][\ndf\n[\n\"bar\"\n]\n>\n5\n]\n=\n100\nFutureWarning: ChainedAssignmentError: behaviour will change in pandas 3.0!\nYou are setting values through chained assignment. Currently this works in certain cases, but when using Copy-on-Write (which will become the default behaviour in pandas 3.0) this will never work to update the original DataFrame or Series, because the intermediate object on which we are setting values will behave as a copy.\nA typical example is when you are setting values in a column of a DataFrame, like:\ndf[\"col\"][row_indexer] = value\nUse `df.loc[row_indexer, \"col\"] = values` instead, to perform the assignment in a single step and ensure this keeps updating the original `df`.\nSee the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\nYou can fix this warning and ensure your code is ready for pandas 3.0 by removing\nthe usage of chained assignment. Typically, this can be done by doing the assignment\nin a single step using for example\n.loc\n. For the example above, we can do:\ndf\n.\nloc\n[\ndf\n[\n\"bar\"\n]\n>\n5\n,\n\"foo\"\n]\n=\n100\nThe same deprecation applies to inplace methods that are done in a chained manner, such as:\n>>>\ndf\n[\n\"foo\"\n]\n.\nfillna\n(\n0\n,\ninplace\n=\nTrue\n)\nFutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.\nThe behavior will change in pandas 3.0. This inplace method will never work because the intermediate object on which we are setting values always behaves as a copy.\nFor example, when doing 'df[col].method(value, inplace=True)', try using 'df.method({col: value}, inplace=True)' or df[col] = df[col].method(value) instead, to perform the operation inplace on the original object.\nWhen the goal is to update the column in the DataFrame\ndf\n, the alternative here is\nto call the method on\ndf\nitself, such as\ndf.fillna({\"foo\":\n0},\ninplace=True)\n.\nSee more details in the\nmigration guide\n.\nDeprecate aliases\nM\n,\nQ\n,\nY\n, etc. in favour of\nME\n,\nQE\n,\nYE\n, etc. for offsets\n#\nDeprecated the following frequency aliases (\nGH 9586\n):\noffsets\ndeprecated aliases\nnew aliases\nMonthEnd\nM\nME\nBusinessMonthEnd\nBM\nBME\nSemiMonthEnd\nSM\nSME\nCustomBusinessMonthEnd\nCBM\nCBME\nQuarterEnd\nQ\nQE\nBQuarterEnd\nBQ\nBQE\nYearEnd\nY\nYE\nBYearEnd\nBY\nBYE\nFor example:\nPrevious behavior\n:\nIn [8]:\npd\n.\ndate_range\n(\n'2020-01-01'\n,\nperiods\n=\n3\n,\nfreq\n=\n'Q-NOV'\n)\nOut[8]:\nDatetimeIndex(['2020-02-29', '2020-05-31', '2020-08-31'],\ndtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='Q-NOV')\nFuture behavior\n:\nIn [26]:\npd\n.\ndate_range\n(\n'2020-01-01'\n,\nperiods\n=\n3\n,\nfreq\n=\n'QE-NOV'\n)\nOut[26]:\nDatetimeIndex(['2020-02-29', '2020-05-31', '2020-08-31'], dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='QE-NOV')\nDeprecated automatic downcasting\n#\nDeprecated the automatic downcasting of object dtype results in a number of\nmethods.

See\nRelease notes\nfor a full changelog\nincluding other versions of pandas.\nEnhancements\n#\nInstalling optional dependencies with pip extras\n#\nWhen installing pandas using pip, sets of optional dependencies can also be installed by specifying extras.\npip\ninstall\n\"pandas[performance, aws]>=2.0.0\"\nThe available extras, found in the\ninstallation guide\n, are\n[all,\nperformance,\ncomputation,\nfss,\naws,\ngcp,\nexcel,\nparquet,\nfeather,\nhdf5,\nspss,\npostgresql,\nmysql,\nsql-other,\nhtml,\nxml,\nplot,\noutput_formatting,\nclipboard,\ncompression,\ntest]\n(\nGH39164\n).\nIndex\ncan now hold numpy numeric dtypes\n#\nIt is now possible to use any numpy numeric dtype in a\nIndex\n(\nGH42717\n).\nPreviously it was only possible to use\nint64\n,\nuint64\n&\nfloat64\ndtypes:\nIn [1]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nint8\n)\nOut[1]:\nInt64Index([1, 2, 3], dtype=\"int64\")\nIn [2]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nuint16\n)\nOut[2]:\nUInt64Index([1, 2, 3], dtype=\"uint64\")\nIn [3]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nfloat32\n)\nOut[3]:\nFloat64Index([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype=\"float64\")\nInt64Index\n,\nUInt64Index\n&\nFloat64Index\nwere deprecated in pandas\nversion 1.4 and have now been removed. Instead\nIndex\nshould be used directly, and\ncan it now take all numpy numeric dtypes, i.e.\nint8\n/\nint16\n/\nint32\n/\nint64\n/\nuint8\n/\nuint16\n/\nuint32\n/\nuint64\n/\nfloat32\n/\nfloat64\ndtypes:\nIn [1]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nint8\n)\nOut[1]:\nIndex([1, 2, 3], dtype='int8')\nIn [2]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nuint16\n)\nOut[2]:\nIndex([1, 2, 3], dtype='uint16')\nIn [3]:\npd\n.\nIndex\n([\n1\n,\n2\n,\n3\n],\ndtype\n=\nnp\n.\nfloat32\n)\nOut[3]:\nIndex([1.0, 2.0, 3.0], dtype='float32')\nThe ability for\nIndex\nto hold the numpy numeric dtypes has meant some changes in Pandas\nfunctionality. In particular, operations that previously were forced to create 64-bit indexes,\ncan now create indexes with lower bit sizes, e.g. 32-bit indexes.\nBelow is a possibly non-exhaustive list of changes:\nInstantiating using a numpy numeric array now follows the dtype of the numpy array.\nPreviously, all indexes created from numpy numeric arrays were forced to 64-bit. Now,\nfor example,\nIndex(np.array([1,\n2,\n3]))\nwill be\nint32\non 32-bit systems, where\nit previously would have been\nint64\neven on 32-bit systems.\nInstantiating\nIndex\nusing a list of numbers will still return 64bit dtypes,\ne.g.\nIndex([1,\n2,\n3])\nwill have a\nint64\ndtype, which is the same as previously.\nThe various numeric datetime attributes of\nDatetimeIndex\n(\nday\n,\nmonth\n,\nyear\netc.) were previously in of\ndtype\nint64\n, while they were\nint32\nfor\narrays.DatetimeArray\n.

This ensures that those\nSeries objects correctly follow the Copy-on-Write rules (\nGH49450\n)\nThe\nSeries\nconstructor will now create a lazy copy (deferring the copy until\na modification to the data happens) when constructing a Series from an existing\nSeries with the default of\ncopy=False\n(\nGH50471\n)\nThe\nDataFrame\nconstructor will now create a lazy copy (deferring the copy until\na modification to the data happens) when constructing from an existing\nDataFrame\nwith the default of\ncopy=False\n(\nGH51239\n)\nThe\nDataFrame\nconstructor, when constructing a DataFrame from a dictionary\nof Series objects and specifying\ncopy=False\n, will now use a lazy copy\nof those Series objects for the columns of the DataFrame (\nGH50777\n)\nThe\nDataFrame\nconstructor, when constructing a DataFrame from a\nSeries\nor\nIndex\nand specifying\ncopy=False\n, will\nnow respect Copy-on-Write.\nThe\nDataFrame\nand\nSeries\nconstructors, when constructing from\na NumPy array, will now copy the array by default to avoid mutating\nthe\nDataFrame\n/\nSeries\nwhen mutating the array. Specify\ncopy=False\nto get the old behavior.\nWhen setting\ncopy=False\npandas does not guarantee correct Copy-on-Write\nbehavior when the NumPy array is modified after creation of the\nDataFrame\n/\nSeries\n.\nThe\nDataFrame.from_records()\nwill now respect Copy-on-Write when called\nwith a\nDataFrame\n.\nTrying to set values using chained assignment (for example,\ndf[\"a\"][1:3]\n=\n0\n)\nwill now always raise a warning when Copy-on-Write is enabled. In this mode,\nchained assignment can never work because we are always setting into a temporary\nobject that is the result of an indexing operation (getitem), which under\nCopy-on-Write always behaves as a copy. Thus, assigning through a chain\ncan never update the original Series or DataFrame. Therefore, an informative\nwarning is raised to the user to avoid silently doing nothing (\nGH49467\n)\nDataFrame.replace()\nwill now respect the Copy-on-Write mechanism\nwhen\ninplace=True\n.\nDataFrame.transpose()\nwill now respect the Copy-on-Write mechanism.\nArithmetic operations that can be inplace, e.g.\nser\n*=\n2\nwill now respect the\nCopy-on-Write mechanism.\nDataFrame.__getitem__()\nwill now respect the Copy-on-Write mechanism when the\nDataFrame\nhas\nMultiIndex\ncolumns.\nSeries.__getitem__()\nwill now respect the Copy-on-Write mechanism when the\nSeries\nhas a\nMultiIndex\n.\nSeries.view()\nwill now respect the Copy-on-Write mechanism.\nCopy-on-Write can be enabled through one of\npd\n.\nset_option\n(\n\"mode.copy_on_write\"\n,\nTrue\n)\npd\n.\noptions\n.\nmode\n.\ncopy_on_write\n=\nTrue\nAlternatively, copy on write can be enabled locally through:\nwith\npd\n.\noption_context\n(\n\"mode.copy_on_write\"\n,\nTrue\n):\n...\nOther enhancements\n#\nAdded support for\nstr\naccessor methods when using\nArrowDtype\nwith a\npyarrow.string\ntype (\nGH50325\n)\nAdded support for\ndt\naccessor methods when using\nArrowDtype\nwith a\npyarrow.timestamp\ntype (\nGH50954\n)\nread_sas()\nnow supports using\nencoding='infer'\nto correctly read and use the encoding specified by the sas file.
